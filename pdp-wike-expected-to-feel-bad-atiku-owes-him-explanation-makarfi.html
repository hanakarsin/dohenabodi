The matter is resolvable,”&nbsp;Makarfi added.</p><p>Speaking further, Makarfi said all hands must be on deck for the PDP to return to winning ways during the 2023 elections.</p><p>He however expressed confidence that his party would return to power.</p><p>“We have learnt our lessons and we will do more than we did when we are in power,” he said.</p><p>“As long as elections will be held in 2023, PDP will win, but we need to work hard for us to win in 2023. PDP is set to bring true democracy back to Nigeria and we have learnt our lessons.”</p><p>Makarfi also debunked rumours that he was nursing plans to dump the PDP for the All Progressives Congress (APC) or any other party.</p><p>He said any report about his defection plan is a rumour which should be ignored.</p><p>“Honestly, I am hearing this for the first time that I am defecting from PDP to APC and I don’t know what can be the basis. Why should I make an investment in terms of time and whatever you can mention in PDP and now decide to leave?” Makarfi asked.</p><p>“Why should I go through the stress and just when we are getting it right, then I now leave the PDP for APC or any other party?</p><p>“What will be the attraction for me to leave the PDP? Well, people don’t approach me with such a rumor because they know the type of person that I am.</p><p>“If they want to come, they come to me with substance. What could be the basis? In every rumour there must be a basis. Is it because members of the opposition party attended my son’s wedding and that is the basis of that rumour?”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpiZH13e5JpZqmcoGLEqrfEZpyxqJWYwaawjK2mZp6VmrlursCdZJqsmaDCbrvWnqpmoJmieqbEz6WYp5mknryvecyaopqqlp58</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./1100356-nigerian-unemployed-graduates-set-quintuplets-photos-html.html><span>←</span><span>Nigerian unemployed graduates welcome their first set of quintuplets (photos)</span></a>
