He noted that it is not enough for the international community to place travel restrictions on perpetrators of electoral violence in the 2023 general elections.</p><p>The Nobel Laureate asked that visa bans be extended to religious bigots.</p><p>Lastly, Soyinka decried the neglect faced by traditionalists in the country, declaring that they “We have had enough”.</p><p>He added:&nbsp;“It’s about time we demanded, on behalf of traditional religions, an annual holiday like Islam and Christianity. We’ve had enough.</p><p>“We’ve had enough of being second-class citizens in this nation. So, equal time, equal space, we demand public holidays.
