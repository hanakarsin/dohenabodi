He said the contest may tear the party apart if the duo insists on fighting for the party ticket.</p><p>Similarly, Kwankwaso’s Edo State coordinator, Francis Ikonomwan, in Abuja on Monday, revealed that pro-Kwankwaso group had commenced moves to reach out to the delegates to make sure that Kano state governor emerges APC’s presidential flag bearer in 2015 general polls.</p><p><i>“We want a paradigm shift; we want a change from the old order and this is why people are clamouring for a realistic change. We have looked at the track record and Kwankwaso is the man that actually meets the demands of the people.</i></p><p><i>“As for Alhaji Atiku, he has lost integrity, you may see people around him, they are hired crowds. Nigerians don’t want him. On General Buhari, he is a man we used to respect, he is a man Nigerians hold in high esteem, but we are surprised that he will be declaring next week. Remember he told us after the 2011 elections that he will not contest again and we expect him to stick to his words as a man of integrity. If he contests again, that shows that he is no longer a man of integrity.</i></p><p><strong>READ ALSO:&nbsp;</strong><a href=#>APC Will End Corruption In Nigeria – Buhari</a></p><p><i>“I want to say that the ambitions of Atiku and General Buhari will tear APC apart. What is best for them is to come behind a younger person and no other person than Rabiu Musa Kwankwaso,”</i> Ikonomwan said.</p><p>The pro- Kwankwaso’s group also called on leaders of the APC not to impose any candidate on the people, saying; <i>“such move is capable of destabilising the party.”</i></p><p>It would be recalled that on September 27, Chairman, House of Representatives Committee on Finance and a member of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Hon Abdulmumin Jibrin also asked former Head of State, Gen. Muhammadu Buhari not to contest in the 2015 presidential election. On September 28, Gen. Muhammadu Buhari and former vice-president Atiku Abubakar, reportedly clashed over the procedure for adopting the 2015 presidential candidate for the party.</p><p>Meanwhile, the Governor of Kano State, Rabiu Musa Kwankwaso, has <a href=#>explained why he wants to become Nigeria's president in 2015.</a></p><p>Source: Legit.ng</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rbHGoqtnppdkf3qEkmxsZmpgZoJurtShmKuhXaeyp8HSnqpmq6SavW6t0qKbnmaYqbqt</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./fuel-subsidy-organised-labour-kicks-against-tinubus-n8000-monthly-palliative.html><span>←</span><span>Organised Labour Kicks Against Tinubus N8000 Monthly Palliative</span></a>
