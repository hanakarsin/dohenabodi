In his touching new song, "Temporary," the rapper dedicates the track to Hailie, envisioning her life after his death and reassuring her of his enduring presence even after he's gone.</p><p>"A lot of people ask me, am I afraid of death? / The truth is, I think what scares me the most is not being able to say all the things I wanna say to you when I'm no longer here," Eminem raps in the intro to the track. "So, this song is for Hailie, for when that day comes."</p><p>Directly addressing Hailie in the song's verses, the wildly popular rapper emphasizes his everlasting support: "Yeah, so Hailie Jade, I wrote you this song / To help you cope with life now that I'm gone / How should I start? Just wanna say / Look after Alaina, Stevie, and Uncle Nate."</p><p>Eminem continues, consoling his daughter with strength: "And, sweetie, be strong, I know I was your rock," he raps. "And I still am, saying goodbye is just not / Ever easy, why you crying? Just stop / Hailie, baby, dry your eye, this is not forever.”</p><p>The heartfelt song even features endearing audio between Eminem and Hailie when she was a little girl. We're not crying, you are!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfmbalecSmoKednah6pa3UoJ%2BtnaJisaqx</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./cary-grant-html.html><span>←</span><span>Cary Grant - Trivia, Family, Bio</span></a>
