In true FromSoftware fashion, you're thrown into the Lands Between without much guidance. Learning how to pick up the skills, like parrying and two-handing weapons, will be incredibly important to felling early enemies and leveling up your character.</p><p>Here's a breakdown of the skills you should master in your first few hours in Elden Ring.</p><ul><li><a href=#>Some tips and tricks to get you started</a></li><li><a href=#>What to do in your first hour of gameplay</a></li><li><a href=#>How to use Ashes</a></li><li><a href=#>How to use Incantations</a></li><li><a href=#>How to use Smithing Stones</a></li><li><a href=#>How to parry enemies</a></li><li><a href=#>How to two-hand a weapon</a></li><li><a href=#>How to level up your character</a></li><li><a href=#>Can you change your starting class?</a></li></ul><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: FromSoftware</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Mastering 'Elden Ring'</h2><span id=mastering-elden-ring class="sc-lmgQde hEekTv"></span><p>Once you've poured about a dozen hours into the game, you'll probably feel more at home with the gameplay mechanics and battling enemies. When you feel comfortable with the basics, it's time to start venturing out and tackling the game's story! Along the way, of course, you'll want to upgrade your items and find new Spirit Summons to help you in battle. Here's a breakdown of some more helpful tips to help you on your journey.</p><ul><li><a href=#>What to do once you've defeated Godrick the Grafted</a></li><li><a href=#>All Talisman Pouch locations</a></li><li><a href=#>All Sacred Tears locations</a></li></ul><ul><li><a href=#>How to upgrade your Spirit Summons</a></li><li><a href=#>Where to find Rune Arcs and Great Runes</a></li><li><a href=#>Where to find Oleg (and how to summon him)</a></li><li><a href=#>How to get Preserving Boluses</a></li><li><a href=#>How to get the "Aspects of the Crucible: Horns" Incantation</a></li><li><a href=#>Where to find the Lake of Rot (and get the materials available there)</a></li><li><a href=#>How to respec your character</a></li><li><a href=#>An explainer on Rebirth (and why you'll need it)</a></li><li><a href=#>Details on the 'Shadow of the Erdtree' expansion</a></li></ul><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: FromSoftware</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Tackling Bosses</h2><span id=tackling-bosses class="sc-lmgQde hEekTv"></span><p>Bosses are one of the most difficult parts of Elden Ring. No matter what level you're at, most of the bosses you come across are going to be incredibly difficult to face off against, and many will likely require multiple attempts before you're successful. But if you think you're ready to face off against Elden Ring's notoriously hard bosses, here are some things to keep in mind.</p><ul><li><a href=#>You can beat Grafted Scion in the opening moments of the game</a></li><li><a href=#>How to beat the Fire Giant</a></li><li><a href=#>Everything to prep for your battle with Malenia</a></li><li><a href=#>All dragon locations</a></li><li><a href=#>How to beat the final boss (spoilers)</a></li><li><a href=#>What's the hardest boss in Elden Ring?</a></li></ul><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: FromSoftware</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Some of the best weapons in 'Elden Ring.'</h2><span id=some-of-the-best-weapons-in-elden-ring class="sc-lmgQde hEekTv"></span><p>Elden Ring is unique because it truly lets the player build their character to fit their specific wants and needs — meaning that while there are a variety of incredible weapons available in the game, what one is best for you will depend entirely on your character's build. Here's a breakdown of some of the best in the game.</p><ul><li><a href=#>How to get the Sword of Night and Flame (and the attributes you need to improve to wield it)</a></li><li><a href=#>The best arcane weapons</a></li><li><a href=#>The best sword</a></li><li><a href=#>The best staff</a></li></ul><p>Elden Ring is very much a title that lets players explore the world however they like, meaning there's no "right" order to complete things in. Once you get the hang of the basics, the path you take will entirely be one of your own design. So feel free to tackle as many (or as few) bosses as you'd like.</p><p>Elden Ring is now available on PS4, PS5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S, and PC.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfmrmlsc1mqaKml2LAtb7ArZygsV2cwqqwxA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./1084268-adama-barrow-return-gambia-tuesday-official-html.html><span>←</span><span>Adama Barrow will return to Gambia on Tuesday - Official</span></a>
