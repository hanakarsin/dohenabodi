It is a shame and a dent on the noble race of Yoruba nation that a governor living at the mercy of tax payers money would find it convenient to descend so low.</p><p>“It is elementary for any reasonable government to know that public facilities are meant for public use. The main bowl of the Osogbo City Stadium we applied to use for today’s rally, for instance, had been put in place and adequately maintained by successive administrations in the state for use of our people even before Alhaji Gboyega Oyetola retraced his history to Osun State from Lagos for political trading.</p><p>“We are not unaware that Mr Gboyega Oyetola by his refusal to grant our party, the required permission to use the facility, was just only testing waters of the large scale violence he is planning against the state.</p><p>“We want to assure him and his cohorts that he would be matched. Any attempt to subvert the electoral verdict of our people will be resisted as bonafide residents of the state. It will not be in his interest nor that of entire country to underestimate this resolve.</p><p>“While we call on President Muhammadu Buhari to be awake about the crisis Oyetola is brewing in Osun State, we call on our people not to be discouraged by the defeatist antics of Mr. Oyetola and his baby vuvuzelas. This election is not just about the PDP or Senator Ademola Jackson Nurudeen Adeleke, but for the good of our people and humanity in general.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpiZH14e5BuZqirpaN6prjEnKuip55ivaW8jKSlqJubqHqwxcStpqWZXaTDpr6Mm6Oom5uWtKZ5zp9kmpuTmsC0edOoZKuZnKHGbsLEp6yeq18%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./ooni-of-ife-pledges-to-report-nigerian-politicians-to-his-ancestors.html><span>←</span><span>Ooni Of Ife Pledges To 'Report' Nigerian Politicians To His Ancestors</span></a>
