When working with a "machine," it's very easy to become some cookie-cutter pinup for a corporation biochemically engineered to sell synthetic tunes to the masses with lyrics that sound like they were either written by AI or North Korean prisoners with a deep-rooted disdain for Western Values.</p><p>Carpenter's lyrics in two of her recent hits, "Espresso" and "Please, Please, Please," manage to inject massive bolts of her personality into the songs, and the production values/layers and individual arrangements of the tracks are swell too.</p><p>So it's no wonder that the young singer's fan base spans multiple age groups and generations, as evidenced by this one fan, who told Sabrina she attended a concert with her mother.</p><p>That kind of flies in the face of the image of a young person trying to go out to a concert with their friends and angrily rolling their eyes whenever their parents try to talk to them about their likes and interests, right?</p><p>However, once Carpenter learned why the young girl brought her mother with her to the concert, she couldn't help but drop to the floor.</p><p>The moment was captured and posted to various <a href=#>TikTok</a> accounts, including Metro Entertainment's (<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">@metroentertainment</a>) channel that simply stated there is no way the response from the fan could "be real."</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a title=@metroentertainment href=#>@metroentertainment</a><p>This CANNOT be real…😮 In a video posted by @ac on TikTok, this young fan revealed to Sabrina Carpenter a secret that literally floored the ‘Espresso’ star. 🫨 What do you make of it? 😱 📲 Follow us for popular entertainment and more. <a title=sabrinacarpenter href=#>#sabrinacarpenter</a> <a title=sabrinacarpenteredit href=#>#sabrinacarpenteredit</a> <a title=sabrinacaprenterespresso href=#>#sabrinacaprenterespresso</a> <a title=espresso href=#>#espresso</a> <a title=sabrinacarpentertour href=#>#sabrinacarpentertour</a> <a title=erastour href=#>#erastour</a> <a title=fanvideo href=#>#fanvideo</a> <a title=fyp href=#>#fyp</a> <a title=foryou href=#>#foryou</a> <a title=fp href=#>#fp</a></p><a title="♬ original sound - Metro Entertainment" href=#>♬ original sound - Metro Entertainment</a></figure><p>The interaction between Sabrina and the fan goes like this:</p><p>Sabrina: Who did you come here with tonight?</p><p>Fan: I'm here with my mom!</p><p>Everyone, including Sabrina, collectively dishes out an "awww" with the singer even bringing the microphone up to her face to express her delight in hearing that.</p><p>Sabrina: Hi, Paloma's mom [waving]</p><p>Audience: Hi, Paloma's mom.</p><p>Sabrina then directs her attention back to the fan, adjusting her hair, and still kneeling at the foot of the stage.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: TikTok | @metroentertainment</span></figure><p>Sabrina: I chose you because you told me that you were heartbroken and I wanted to know what happened.</p><p>The pop star then places the microphone in front of the young woman again so she can give her answer.</p><p>Fan: My mom slept with my boyfriend and she doesn't know I know.</p><p>Sabrina then covers her mouth as everyone in the audience starts gasping. The pop star attempts to stifle her laughter and she collapses on the stage.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: TikTok | @metroentertainment</span></figure><p>The young girl turns around and then looks at the camera and nods her head, mouthing the word, "yeah."</p><p>Several people who responded to the video referenced <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Paloma Diamond</a>, a fictional actress who is trending on the popular social media platform.</p><p>And while there was plenty of debate among folks who saw the video and wondered whether or not if it was the real deal, there were a lot of folks who were absolutely convinced that it was.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: TikTok | @metroentertainment</span></figure><p>"THE WAY SABRINA's SOUL LEFT HER BODY WHEN THE REALIZATION HIT," one person wrote.</p><p>Someone else echoed: "I think all of our souls left at the same time."</p><p>"The fact she wanted her mom to be with her to reveal this IS D--- WOW," another replied.</p><p>"You know the car ride home was QUIET" another TikToker remarked.</p><p>And then there was someone who said that if they ever met a person who honestly had this experience, they fully expect them to reveal this information right when they're meeting for the first time.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: TikTok | @metroentertainment</span></figure><p>"Usually I'm against trauma dumping but absolutely tell me this. I don't care if we met seven seconds ago, this needs to be the opening tea."</p><p>Others just thought the way the Sabrina Carpenter fan opened the story up and used the concert as a means of dropping the bombshell is fantastic: "The way she gets to tell you who she's with first and it's her mom and she was chosen to speak is chef kiss."</p><p>How do you feel about the concert reveal? Did Paloma unfurl a little too much about her familial life? Should she have played certain things a bit closer to the chest? Or did her mother ultimately deserve being outed the way that she was?</p><p>That is, if it's legitimate. Do you think that it is?</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfm66vecSxp6irlah6rrvMZqqamqKeu6J5wpqpqZ2eqbKzecKopZydoqk%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./amelia-hamlin-html.html><span>←</span><span>Amelia Gray Hamlin - Age, Family, Bio</span></a>
