The pair were in the process of planning their wedding, though they had decided to postpone it until further notice, reportedly due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.</p><p>After Gabby was reported missing by her parents on Sept. 11, Brian and his parents refused to cooperate with law enforcement and did not disclose any information on Gabby's last known whereabouts to the authorities.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Instagram</span></figure><p>“We beg you to tell us,” a letter from Gabby's parents to the Laundrie family read, according to the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">New York Post</a>. “As a parent how could you put Gabby’s younger brothers and sisters through this?
