Most of them have important lessons that can teach you how to love your partner better and avoid making mistakes that other people have already made.</p><h2>10 books that make you think about love differently</h2><p class=align-left>Some people do not like reading. Therefore, they end up missing out on a lot of information that can potentially save or make their relationships better. Here are the top 10 books about love and the respective authors:</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/7e95f383b5a00693.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>20 best quotes from To Kill a Mockingbird that will blow your mind</span></p></a><h3>1. Bluets - Maggie Nelson</h3><p class=align-left>Maggie Nelson’s <i>Bluets </i>offers a less conventional approach to the concept of love. The writer has structured it in a list of personal anecdotes, sporadic musings, philosophical theories and cultural references about the colour blue. It is not what you would expect from the usual books about love and life, but the writer does incredible writing about the subjective nature of love.</p><p class=align-left>She argues that the supposition of experiential quality as an intrinsic quality of the physical object is a systematic illusion of both colour and love. The book is not only inventive in form but also emotionally moving.</p><h3>2. Zippermouth - Laurie Weeks</h3><p class=align-left>If in need of books about love psychology, look for <i>Zippermouth</i>. The book explores the burden of unrequited love, uninspiring desk jobs and claustrophobic cities.</p><p class=align-left>The protagonist has presented all these things in a manner they feel a little more absurd and sardonic. Reading <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener"><i>Zippermouth</i> </a>paints a chilling and gripping picture of what it can be like to live on the edge.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/6109147c5cb8a58e.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Ugandan man finally marries American woman he met on dating app</span></p></a><p class=align-left>It is about a lady who falls into drug abuse and mental illness and still has to cope with unrequited love. It teaches us how love makes us gullible to the point we cannot eat or even sleep. Many readers relate to the agony of loving someone who is out of reach, and that is what Laurie Weeks writes about.</p><h3>3. Lunch Poems<i> </i>- Frank O’Hara</h3><p class=align-left>The relationship between love and poetry is as old as man himself. Poetry is one of the most romantic ways to express love insightfully. Frank O’Hara manages to draw short and silly yet insightful lessons from everyday observations that most people would consider insignificant.</p><p class=align-left>Just like the title says, Frank composed the poems during his lunch break. The poems will restore you and give you a fresh look of what love is. It might also score you to recite some of the poems to your loved one.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/4244aa89211a6ccb.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Who is a fitness enthusiast?

This is How You Lose Her<i> </i>- Junot Diaz</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/7e95f383b5a00693.jpeg><p class=align-left>Have you ever wondered why and how you keep ruining your love life? This book is all about how one can ruin a relationship. This can help you know what to avoid if you want to sustain your relationship. The book is a<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener"> collection of short stories</a>, especially for the broken-hearted.</p><p class=align-left>It is life-changing and comforting to people who have gone through heartbreaks. Junot also focuses on certain moods and several cultural norms that shape love in modern times. According to the writer, love will forever have its disappointments.</p><h3>5. Night Sky With Exit Wounds - Ocean Vuong</h3><p class=align-left>This collection of poems evokes emotions that run deep. The poems are carefully crafted with lyrical narratives that are not only relatable but also introduce readers to the feelings they would have found difficult to place previously. It is the best book to give someone you love.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/6ae6aefc19bc97c4.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Karen haircut: What is it and why should you avoid it?</span></p></a><p class=align-left>The book is about loving and losing love. It also gives hope to those who have endured the pain of seeing their loved ones perish. The clever wordplay also makes readers fall in love with the language despite everything else feeling hopeless.</p><h3>6. Lust & Other Stories - Susan Minot</h3><p class=align-left>The heading gives it away, and if you are looking for books about true love, you might as well want to know about lust. This book is mostly about the opposite of love, lust. Lust is everything people do in the absence of love, and Susan captures this really well in her book.</p><p class=align-left>Expect to read about a <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">chronicle of lovers</a> from the writer’s teenage years. Susan has written the stories in a way everyone can relate to them.</p><h3>7. The God of Small Things - Arundhati Roy</h3><p class=align-left><i>The God of Small Things</i> is about everything from politics to family, but you can't forget the reoccurring theme of forbidden love. It is a rich book and one you will remember forever because of the brilliance with which it has been written.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/5fe55ae8b3064cec.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>100+ most beautiful status about love for WhatsApp</span></p></a><p class=align-left>The writer presents a world of emptiness that comes with the feeling of two people who love each other but cannot be together. He refers to that kind of love as hideous grief because nothing good can come out of a situation like that. Some readers can’t help but think that this might be the best love story ever written.</p><h3>8. Your Art Will Save Your Life - Beth Pickens</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/6109147c5cb8a58e.jpeg><p class=align-left>The title of the book is thought-evoking and couldn’t be more spot-on when talking about love. It is not centred on romantic love because the writer wrote it in response to the election of President Trump in the US. This love letter to artists is meant to give people hope in times of uncertainty and hardships.</p><p class=align-left>People can easily give up when saddened and overwhelmed by the state of the world. Beth reminds her readers that they are never alone. Her love for art can go a long way in bringing positive change to the world.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/6d7ce0f0a4347c04.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>100+ rest in peace quotes for grandpa and grandma</span></p></a><h3>9. No One Belongs Here More Than You - Miranda July</h3><p class=align-left><i>No One Belongs Here More Than You</i> is one of the best fiction books about love. When you feel like you are engulfed in a world of darkness, read this book, and it will shed some light in your life. Most of the stories in the book are sad ones, but the writer knows how to twist them into a silver lining.</p><p class=align-left>Miranda's stories are short, but they do not lack when it comes to their messages and lessons. Each character portrays the beauty of the natural world, making everything completely relatable.</p><h3>10. So Sad Today - Melissa Broder</h3><p class=align-left><i>So Sad Today</i> is a kind of confessional story that somehow makes heartbreaks less scary. After reading it, you will realize that it is okay to be anxious at times and that being imperfect is part and parcel of life. Melissa manages to mix <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">sadness and humour</a> to lighten things up and allow the reader to digest accounts easily.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/964711c78a48c39d.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Thoughtful African proverbs about love</span></p></a><p class=align-left><i>So Sad Today</i> is more of a self-reflection on what happens when two people stop loving one another. The writer asks what happens to the space that two lovers occupy when they are no longer together. How can that space disappear instead of becoming something else? When it comes to the best books on love philosophy, this one ranks at the top.</p><p class=align-left>There is no shortage of books that make you think about love differently. Most talk about the sadness that is associated with not being loved or losing a loved one, but at the end of it, they show that there is always a light at the end of the tunnel. Here, you will also find several romantic poems that can re-ignite the fire of your love life.</p><p class=align-left><a href=#>Tuko.co.ke</a> recently shared an article on <a href=#>how to cite a website</a> without an author. It is not surprising that students do not know how to cite a website without an author because they often go for the sites with an author.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/e307adda0fd9ba6b.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>The most rib-cracking love quotes of all time</span></p></a><p class=align-left>The lack of familiarity in this concept has made most students fail when it comes to referencing.
