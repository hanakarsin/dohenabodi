Has he done anything wrong?</p><p>“Tell me one state in Nigeria where you have a non-indigene in the cabinet. I can tell you, the only state where that happens is Lagos state.</p><p>“The Director-General of Budget Office in Nigeria, one of the highest positions in Nigeria, what is his name? Ben Akabueze. Is he from Lagos? No, he is from the South East and Asiwaju put him there.</p><p>”He determines the budget. Whatever money any agency or department is looking for, it must come to Akabueze’s table. He determines whether to give or not to give. That is a man from the South East, put there by Asiwaju Tinubu.</p><p>“And I can give you many more names. So, why will a man that has done much for the Igbos now come to you for votes, and you tell him he has not done bad, he has done well, but because he is not from the South East, we have somebody from the South East to vote for. I think that is not the way to go.”</p><p>Gbajabiamila said the APC presidential candidate was passionate about the development of Nigeria, adding he would care for all the people of the country if elected.</p><p>The Speaker added that the 2023 election was about the progress of the country and urged Nigerians to vote for competence rather than tribe or religion.</p><p>He added: “One thing I can assure all Nigerians is that when Asiwaju Bola Tinubu becomes the president of this country, he will be president for all.</p><p>“He will care for the Yoruba people, he will care for South-South, he will care for the Igbos, he will care for the Nupes and the northerners.</p><p>“He is the only candidate that has proven himself well. He has the capacity and will deliver.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpiZH5ze5FuZmtoYmh6tbXNrpmuZZiWwG6wzqecZq%2BVobluss6rZLKnpWLBsHnVqKueZZakv260yKZkoJqRn66jtcCmoKWZXamyrbjSZqCgmp%2BofA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./gwyneth-paltrow-kids.html><span>←</span><span>What Apple and Moses Are Up to Now</span></a>
