Dr. Gail Saltz, Clinical Associate Professor of Psychiatry at the NY Presbyterian Hospital Weill-Cornell School of Medicine, told Parade that almond mom behavior includes encouraging children to eat less to look thin, expressing a preference for thinness, and cloaking disordered eating as “healthy” eating."><meta name=author content="Hettie Henneman"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>

They may very well be wrestling with their own body acceptance, or they could even be suffering from body dysmorphia or an underlying eating disorder.”</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Yolanda Hadid inadvertently started the “Almond Mom” TikTok meme.</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Photo by Hayley Maxwell on Unsplash</span></figure><p style=text-align:start>As <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">BuzzFeed News</a> reports, <a href=#>Yolanda Hadid </a>cemented her place as the O.G. “Almond Mom” in a 2013 episode of <a href=#>The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills </a>when she advised daughter <a href=#>Gigi Hadid</a> to “have a couple of almonds and chew on them really well” after Gigi reported feeling weak.</p><p>In 2022, Yolanda told <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">People</a> the clip had been taken "so far" out of context.</p><p>"This was a small little clip from Housewives,” she explained. “Gigi was calling because she wasn't feeling good, and I apparently said, half asleep, ‘Have two almonds.’ I don't even remember why two or what. There was no rhyme or reason to it. It's such a silly narrative that is out there, that has nothing to do with the reality of our lives."</p><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-dTSxUT dyQypj"></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Anyone, a mother or otherwise, can be an almond mom.</h2><p style=text-align:start>These days, the term “almond mom” refers to a person “who encourage[s] or perpetuate[s] diet culture or disordered eating behavior in children, thus passing unhealthy eating habits from generation to generation,” in the words of BuzzFeed News’ Fjolla Arifi.</p><p style=text-align:start>And Fjolla adds that mothers aren’t the other almond moms out there: “Any parent, caregiver, family friend, or relative can perpetuate unhealthy eating behaviors in children by body-shaming or using language that promotes diet culture.”</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a title=@tyler.benderr href=#>@tyler.benderr</a><p>Core memory: eating my friends halloween candy <a title=almondmom href=#>#almondmom</a> <a title=halfanalmondaday href=#>#halfanalmondaday</a> <a title=almondmompantry href=#>#almondmompantry</a> <a title=dietculturedropout href=#>#dietculturedropout</a></p><a title="♬ Elevator Music - Renja Ferry" href=#>♬ Elevator Music - Renja Ferry</a></figure><p style=text-align:start>In one TikTok video, user @tyler.benderr acts the part of an “almond child” going to a friend’s house — and realizing that holiday candy decor can be eaten, that pizzerias aren’t just open once a month, fore example.</p><p style=text-align:start>And in <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">a TikTok video</a> uploaded by @betches, a performer acts out almond mom behavior, saying things like, “I got organic, sugar-free hot cocoa.

Inadequate nutrition and restrictive behaviors can lead to electrolyte and hormonal imbalances, hair loss, gastrointestinal disturbances, infertility, and worst case, sudden cardiac death.”</p><p><strong>If you or someone you know is struggling with an eating disorder, call the </strong><a href=#><strong>National Eating Disorders Association</strong></a><strong> Helpline at 1-800-931-2237.</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfrLWiwIyiqmaZnmKurbnOp5tmpZ%2BierW1yq2mpA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./presidency-speaks-on-little-difference-between-ipob-and-yoruba-nation-agitators.html><span>←</span><span>Presidency Speaks On Little Difference Between IPOB And Yoruba Nation Agitators</span></a>
