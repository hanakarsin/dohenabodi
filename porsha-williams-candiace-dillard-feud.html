RHOP fans will recall that Candiace and <a href=#>Monique Samuels</a> got into a physical fight during a trip to a winery. The fight caused Bravo to fire Monique from the show after four seasons. Candiace also eventually filed a lawsuit against Monique for dragging her by the hair during the fight.</p><p>In December 2020, Porsha discussed Candiace and Monique’s lawsuit on Bravo’s Chat Room with <a href=#>Gizelle Bryant</a>, Hannah Berner, and Kate Chastain, per <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Page Six</a>. During the show, she informed her co-hosts that her friend Monique felt Candiace had ulterior motives for taking legal action.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-dTSxUT dyQypj"><p></p></figure><p>Porsha continued to say that she heard Candiace’s tea “personally from Monique’s mouth.” Nonetheless, Candiace came for Porsha directly after Chat Room aired, and she called Pilar Jhena’s mom a “sidekick.”</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Also, she said Porsha was lying and spreading false information — "damning, defaming information.” Candiace also warned Porsha to “be careful about the lies that she tells,” noting that lying is “a very dangerous move.”</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Candiace Dillard Bassett would vacation with Porsha Williams again despite their past.</h2><p>Two years after Candiace’s comments about Porsha, the ladies spent a one-week getaway in Phuket, Thailand, alongside <a href=#><strong>fellow </strong><strong>RHUGT </strong><strong>stars</strong></a> Heather Gay, Whitney Rose, Gizelle Bryant, Alexia Echevarria, Leah McSweeney, and Marysol Patton.</p><p>Before the Peacock show’s Season 3 premiere, Candiace hinted at being in a better place with Porsha since their trip.

During Candiace’s <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">ladyboy show</a> — Thailand’s name for a drag show — she gave her castmates “drag” names for the night. However, Candiace’s name for Gizelle and Porsha seemingly hit too close to home. She named Gizelle, who is single, “Sh’Neda Mann” (with two N’s) and gave Porsha “Sh’Taka Mann.”</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Candiace was wrong in both arguments with Porsha which is uncommon for her… she’s clouded by something porsha said over 3 years ago. <a href=#>#RHUGT3</a></p>— chaos 16.3  (@ThatsSoShelli) <a href=#>March 23, 2023</a></figure><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>When Porsha and Candiace discussed the name at a group dinner, Candiace told Porsha she was only repeating what “the streets” heard, which caused Porsha to clarify that she and Simon started dating after he announced his divorce.</p><p>The fight didn’t surprise many fans waiting for the two stars to duke it out verbally.
