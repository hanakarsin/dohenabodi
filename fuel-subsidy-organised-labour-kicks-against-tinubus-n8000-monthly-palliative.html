If he has a budget already, it means that he already has activities he has planned on his own. If he has that, what is the need of the Committees? The action of the President has actually undermined the credibility of his own Committee</p><p>“We believe that it is not only undemocratic but shows that the President is merely setting up the committee as a window dressing for whatever purposes he has set out for himself.</p><p>“When you also look at what he has planned, to give ₦8,000 to households for six months which approximates to N48, 000, you ask yourself, can N48,000 address the millions of suffering the government has already inflicted on the poor?</p><p>“Will it make any significant impact in addressing the consequences already being faced by Nigerians? Will the suffering suddenly end after six months?”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpjZH14e5BtZp%2BtlaF6tMHBrKCdsV2kv6itzaKqnpxdoa6ju9SrZKShk6DAbq3GmqCnq6Riwaq61JusrGWebX1xfIympqesmKHGbrzApaOimaSew6Z7</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./will-netflix-pick-up-manifest.html><span>←</span><span>Netflix Picks up 'Manifest' Season 4 of the Show Is Officially On</span></a>
