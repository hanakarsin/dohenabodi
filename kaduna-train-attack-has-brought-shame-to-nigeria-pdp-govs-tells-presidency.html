There can be no better evidence of government adrift, unconcerned and rudderless — without care about how the economy runs.” the statement reads in part.</p><p>Recall that<a href=#><strong> Shehu had</strong> <strong>described the opposition party as a serial failure</strong></a>, saying that the PDP and its members plundered the nation’s resources during their sixteen years in power.</p><p>He added that the damages done by the PDP are still been cleaned up by the ruling APC administration led by <strong><a href=#>President Muhammadu Buhari</a></strong>.</p><p>In a statement on Monday by the Director-General, <strong>C.I.D. Maduabum</strong>, the PDP Governors’ Forum slammed Shehu for being totally oblivious of the sufferings and agonies of Nigeria due to his privileged position.</p><p>The governors said all aspects of life in the country are being systematically destroyed by the APC led administration, adding that the Buhari government is the worst in Nigeria’s history in managing the nation’s diversity.</p><p>However, they asked the Buhari administration to immediately address the country’s security challenges before terrorists take over the nation.</p><p>The statement reads: ”We are moved to respond to the infantile, ignorant, pedestrian, low quality, confused and rambling response of Garba Shehu, spokesman of the so-called Presidency, an amorphous entity, to the fact-filled patriotic, well-thought-out chronicle of the dire living conditions of Nigerians by the PDP Governors in their communiqué of March 23, 2022, for the need to set the records straight.</p><p>“Garba Shehu described the communiqué as a fantasy, delusional and fictional. He even derided the Nigerian armed forces as ‘phantom soldiers’.</p><p>“Perhaps he was dazed by the sheer assemblage of facts, figures and evidence on the existential threat Nigeria is facing as a result of the APC misrule, with respect to the economy, security, stealing of Nigeria’s crude, etc., as contained in the communiqué.</p><p>“The PDP Governors communiqué made a comparative sketch of Nigeria of 2015 under PDP and Nigeria of 2022 under APC. The communiqué reeled out the fact that in almost all sectors, things have gotten worse by over 1000%.</p><p>“This is reflected in prices of basic foodstuffs, unemployment rate, electricity prices, kerosene, diesel, fuel, aviation fuel and air ticket prices which have all gone through the roof. It reeled out figures on poverty, inflation, exchange rate, debt accumulation and corruption.</p><p>“Indeed, all aspects of life in Nigeria are being systematically destroyed by the APC administration. Life has become short, brutish and valueless in Buhari’s Nigeria as insecurity ravages the land. But this is not the problem of Garba Shehu, who is enveloped in the Presidential Villa, totally oblivious of the suffering and agony Nigerians are facing.</p><p>“Garba Shehu accused PDP Governors of influencing ethnic and religious tensions. How does pointing out the deteriorating state of affairs in Nigeria inflame ethnic and religious tensions? The Buhari Presidency by all objective accounts is the worst in Nigeria’s history in managing our diversity,” the governors said.</p><p>“Under APC’s 7 years rule, Nigerians no longer trust one another, ethnic and religious differences are not properly managed. All our fault lines are exposed and exacerbated.</p><p>“Garba Shehu had the temerity to praise the military success under Buhari as compared to the PDP. That someone in today’s Nigeria can be this tone-deaf to the cheapening of life in Nigeria under the watch of the APC is, to say the least, unfortunate.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpiZH11e49uZqSZlKq7onnTq5iipl2WwbWtwqRkoZmjYq%2Bzu9Sgn61lo52urrGMraZmppmcsrO1wGannahdnLy3v4ytnKWko2K9s7HSopueppOufA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./bandit-terrorists-again-kill-two-in-fresh-southern-kaduna-attack.html><span>←</span><span>Bandit Terrorists Again Kill Two In Fresh Southern Kaduna Attack</span></a>
