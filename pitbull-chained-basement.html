That's because they love the heck out of you and that kind of love doesn't come with total trust.</p><p>It's a big reason why people jokingly say, "we don't deserve dogs," because the sad reality is that not all dog owners reciprocate the same amount of love they have for their pets that their pets may have for them.</p><p>Dog owners sometimes abuse the trust their pets have in them, like whoever seemingly left this pit bull chained and abandoned in a dark basement of this house.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: stray rescue of st. louis</span></figure><p>As the owner was getting ready to move into his new home, he checked the basement and heard some shuffling. After what I'm assuming is the appropriate response, which is being scared to high heck, when he investigated he saw the poor little pit bull chained up. He immediately placed a call to the Stray Rescue of St. Louis to inform them of the sad find.</p><p>"I just bought a house and there is a pit bull chained up in the basement.

She was nearly choking herself as she was so excited to see us. When we freed her, she couldn‚Äôt stop jumping up and down and giving hugs," said Natalie Thomson, group communications director.<figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: stray rescue of st. louis</span></figure><p>They decided to name the girl Jumping Bean, on account of how excited she was upon seeing the rescuers, and she has plenty reason to be happy.</p><p>Judging by her living conditions, her situation looked dire: no food or water bowls were in sight in the basement - Jumping Bean didn't have much time left. Despite her traumatic experience, her love of life hasn't dwindled at all.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: stray rescue of st. louis</span></figure><p>Rescuers can't say enough about Jumping Bean's energy, happy demeanor, and affection she shows everyone.</p>"Her personality is completely adorable. She loves everyone she meets and craves attention. She makes sure she is not ignored! She‚Äôs an energetic and very affectionate pup! She is so happy all the time."&nbsp;<p>Jumping Bean is just another example of pit bulls defying the "violent dog" stereotype.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>friendly reminder that before pitbulls were labeled fighting dogs, they were known as nanny dogs because of how gentle and caring they are with their owners.
