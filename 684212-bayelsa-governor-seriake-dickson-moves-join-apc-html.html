His argument was that he recognised the fact that Bayelsa state cannot afford to remain in opposition to the ruling party.</i></p><p><i>“We know of a fact that this would be the second time Governor Seriake Dickson would be seeking to dump the PDP for the APC in the course of elections in thes.</i></p><p><i>“The first time was in the heat of the National Assembly primaries of early last year when he sought to replace all serving National Assembly members from the&nbsp; State with his cronies against the wishes of former President Goodluck Jonathan, who wanted the performing ones to be returned.</i></p><p><i>“On that occasion, he openly threatened both the former President and the PDP hierarchy of his readiness to decamp to the APC&nbsp; and using his past relationship with the APC National Leader, Sen. Bola Tinubu to secure tickets for his preferred candidates, as well as himself to defeat the PDP at the polls.</i></p><p><i>“Of course he got his way in that election with Dr. Jonathan despite sponsored verbal and media attacks against the former First Lady, Dame Patience.</i></p><p><i>“But unfortunately for Mr. Dickson, the APC unlike his party, the PDP, will not fall for such cheap antics and the officials he met with, clearly told him there was no deal. He therefore, had to return home deflated and empty handed.”</i></p><p><strong>READ ALSO:</strong> APC In Potential Break or Make Meeting&nbsp;</p><p>But in a swift reaction to Egba's claims, the state chapter of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in a statement signed by the Director, Restoration Campaign Organisation (RCO), Jonathan Obuebite, denied the allegation.</p><p>He said:<i> “Governor Dickson has no reason to defect to the APC in order to win an election that had ahead been won. We call on APC to accept the fact that they had lost this election. They have not only lost, they have also been roundly rejected by the people. No amount of propaganda, lies and deceit can change the outcome of an election that had already been won by the PDP.”</i></p><p>Recall that the Bayelsa state governorship election was held on Saturday, December 5, but that of the Southern Ijaw region was nullified by the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) and the election was declared inconclusive.</p><p>INEC said the election was nullified due to violence, abduction of electoral officials and ballot box snatching in the area.&nbsp;Results already announced indicates that Governor Dickson is leading in the poll.</p><p>However, both Dickson and Sylva have been asking to be declared winner of the election by INEC.</p><p>Source: Legit.ng</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rbHGoqtnppdkg3mAkWppZpqRrrKtv8Bmnqiulae7sL6MrJyroZGgsm6wyJyirKeeYrqwwsSsZKOnmaN6orzCZ5%2BtpZw%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=next href=./siya-html.html><span>Siya - Age, Family, Bio</span><span>→</span></a></nav></article></main><footer class=footer><p>&copy; 2024 <a href=./></a></p><p>Powered by <a href=https://gohugo.io/ rel=noopener target=_blank>Hugo️️</a>️</p></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_1.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
