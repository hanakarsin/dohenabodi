There are some pretty cool creatures — like leopards, rhinos, and orangutans (oh my!) — on the endangered species list. But for some reason, the worst of all species just keeps multiplying.

The Airbnb they booked looked fine, but Sara later learned that looks can be deceiving.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>“Last week, I flew into Colorado for a friend’s bachelorette event and we checked into a very nice, very clean Airbnb. The first thing I do is check for bedbugs: I lift up the fitted sheet, I check every corner and there is nothing, so I sleep in the bed,” she said in the viral <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">video</a>, which has more than 7 million views as of this writing.</p><p>“And the next morning when I wake up with like one or two bug bites on my arms, I assume that they’re [from mosquitoes] from sitting on the patio the day before. I want to say two or three more bug bites appeared throughout the day, and this is where my knowledge truly failed me,” Sarah went on.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>It wasn’t until they checked out of the Airbnb that "things really started taking a turn for the worse." She added, “Every five minutes, a bite that I did not previously have was appearing on my body.”</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>As Sarah’s symptoms worsened, she and her group returned to the Airbnb to check for bed bugs again. Sure enough, they found them.</p><p>While every other person in the house had wooden headboards on their beds, Sarah’s was cloth. And it just so happens that dozens of bed bugs had found themselves at home in there, hence the bites all over her body. But her bed bug saga didn’t end there.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"></figure><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>“Five or six days after I got the initial bites, I woke up and my bites were suddenly the size of, like, golf balls,” Sarah said, revealing photos of the aftermath. “All I could do for like two days was pop Benadryl after Benadryl and just sleep through the pain.”</p><p>Sarah said that Airbnb later gave the group their money back. As a result, Sarah came out as the hero in the story. “[The] good news is that no one else got bit and Airbnb is completely refunding us,” Sarah said.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"></figure><p>“So my friend is sending everybody their money back and it’s kind of like I won everybody a free Airbnb trip and all it cost was a little anaphylaxis," she concluded her story.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfl7KlecGunqxlmaN6orXRm6Wb</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./beware-advantage-survivor-rules.html><span>←</span><span>Survivor's Beware Advantage Rules Explained</span></a>
