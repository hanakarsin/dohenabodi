Some, like the mob wife aesthetic and <a href=#>cottagecore</a>, are distinct from each other, while others tend to meld together.</p><p>Currently, the coquette aesthetic is the latest trend taking over the app. Coquette is defined as "a woman who flirts," but to nail the current look of this trend, there's no flirting required.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-uxeQQ ibmIIm">Coquette is a very niche trend, focused on baby pink and bows.</h2><p>The influx of <a href=#>pink bow emojis</a> on TikTok can be directly linked to the rise in the coquette aesthetic, which focuses largely on outfits, nails, and accessories adorned with dainty pink bows. Though it follows a similarly light color palette to previous trends like cottagecore, those who are heavily entrenched in the trend are vocal about the differences between them ‚Äî and if you want to partake, you better be ready to know what sets them apart.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><p>Where cottagecore is an airy aesthetic, focus on nature, billowy white fabrics, and hair scarves, coquette is much more niche than that. Dating back to the days of Marie Antoinette, coquette leans heavily on hyper-feminine pieces and motifs. You're likely to see outfits consisting of a lot of baby pink and white with coquette.</p><p>Coquette is closer to balletcore, though the addition of dainty bows will be what ultimately make it a coquette look.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a title=@dear_terryberry href=#>@dear_terryberry</a><p>The most detailed winter outfit I‚Äôve made so far üòç outfit details are linked on my LTK in my bio if you wanna check them out!! ü´∂üíï <a title=coquettecore href=#>#coquettecore</a> <a title=coquette href=#>#coquette</a> <a title=coquetteaesthetic href=#>#coquetteaesthetic</a> <a title=coquettegirl href=#>#coquettegirl</a> <a title=coquettedoll href=#>#coquettedoll</a> <a title=coquetteoutfit href=#>#coquetteoutfit</a> <a title=coquettefashion href=#>#coquettefashion</a> <a title=coquetteaccount href=#>#coquetteaccount</a> <a title=coquettedollette href=#>#coquettedollette</a> <a title=winterfashion2022 href=#>#winterfashion2022</a> <a title=winterfashiontrends href=#>#winterfashiontrends</a> <a title=winterfashion href=#>#winterfashion</a> <a title=winteroutfit href=#>#winteroutfit</a> <a title=winteroutfits href=#>#winteroutfits</a> <a title=winteroutfitideas href=#>#winteroutfitideas</a> <a title=winteroutfitinspo href=#>#winteroutfitinspo</a> <a title=winterstylefashion href=#>#winterstylefashion</a> <a title=winterlook href=#>#winterlook</a> <a title=dolletteaesthetic href=#>#dolletteaesthetic</a> <a title=dollette href=#>#dollette</a> <a title=girlyoutfit href=#>#girlyoutfit</a> <a title=pinkcore href=#>#pinkcore</a> <a title=pinkmas href=#>#pinkmas</a> <a title=pinkaesthetic href=#>#pinkaesthetic</a> <a title=pinkfeed href=#>#pinkfeed</a> <a title=femininestyle href=#>#femininestyle</a> <a title=girlystyle href=#>#girlystyle</a> <a title=classystyle href=#>#classystyle</a></p><a title="‚ô¨ Until I Found You - Em Beihold Version - Stephen Sanchez & Em Beihold" href=#>‚ô¨ Until I Found You - Em Beihold Version - Stephen Sanchez & Em Beihold</a></figure><p>Though the trend has been all over TikTok, not everyone is in love with it. For starters, the aesthetic sexualizes infantilizing looks, making many uncomfortable. Unfortunately, thin white women are also often considered to be the standard frame for this aesthetic, leading to some backlash among POC and those with bigger bodies.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-uxeQQ ibmIIm">Various celebrities have been associated with the coquette aesthetic over the years.</h2><p><a href=#>Lana Del Rey</a> has long been considered the icon most associated with the coquette aesthetic, though some on TikTok <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">disagree</a>. Though her look incorporates the lace, bows, and feminine color palette coquette is known for, there's a lot of debate online that her look is more Americana than coquette.</p><p>Regardless, as the trend has become increasingly popular, more and more celebs are stepping out in looks that are clearly coquette-inspired.</p><p>Sydney Sweeney's 2023 <a href=#>Met Gala</a> look is a great example of the coquette trend. Between the hyper-feminine mermaid silhouette, the pale pink fabric, and the addition of big, black bows, it nails the aesthetic beautifully.</p><p>Lily-Rose Depp's hyperfeminine looks are also often associated with the coquette trend. Though many of her looks for The Idol press tour were black, her affinity for dainty, frilly pieces is a big influence on the coquette trend.</p><p>Ultimately, micro-trends like the coquette aesthetic can be easily blended into one's personal style, and though the internet has many opinions on what qualifies as coquette, this one isn't likely to stick around any longer than the next, so take what works for you and leave the rest.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfmLyywcStq55lpKeyr7CMraCkrJ%2Bg</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./2023-pandef-knocks-pdp-for-throwing-presidential-ticket-open-tells-apc-what-to-do.html><span>‚Üê</span><span>PANDEF Knocks PDP For Throwing Presidential Ticket Open, Tells APC What To Do</span></a>
