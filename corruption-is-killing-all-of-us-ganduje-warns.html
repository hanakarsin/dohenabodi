My reason is that this organization has a dual role and responsibility.</p><p>“Its first role is of course public complaints. That means, people with some complaints could lodge it at the commission, get it sorted out and resolved amicably. This is not what you can call a crime.</p><p>“On the other hand, anti-corruption is of course a fight against crime, which means, the double role should not be misconstrued or lost, that is the fight against a crime.</p><p>“So, I urge the committee to bring out the strategies whereby the people of Kano State would have the benefit of hope to complain when the need arises, and get amicable settlement.</p><p>“Whether it is against the government or government officials, the complaints could be looked into and sorted out,” the Governor said.</p><p>The chairman of the committee who also doubles as chairman of the state PCAC, <strong>Muhyi Magaji-Rimingado</strong>, assured the Governor that all corruption related issues affecting the growth and development of the state will be sorted out by the committee.</p><p>He promised that all necessary legal and policy frameworks will be put in place to make the anti-corruption war effective.</p><p>Meanwhile, the Office of the National Security Adviser (ONSA) has <strong><a href=# rel=noopener>given an explanation</a></strong> on the viral press release warning of planned attacks by hoodlums on airports in Nigeria.</p><p>According to a statement on Thursday signed by the Head of Strategic Communication, Office of the National Security Adviser, Z.M Usman, the said press release was just a routine threat assessment that unfortunately found its way to the public domain.</p><p>It added that the press release shouldn’t have been made available to the general public but was expected to ensure the preparedness of relevant agencies against any attack against the nation’s airports.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWphZH11e5JpZpynoqfCscDIqKVmoaNiuKq4y6KloGWRobluu8VmrKxll5a7pcHJnmSwmaKjwHA%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./wikes-endorsement-of-sanwo-olu-jandor-frustrated-and-desperate-lagos-apc.html><span>←</span><span>Wikes Endorsement Of Sanwo-Olu: Jandor Frustrated And Desperate</span></a>
