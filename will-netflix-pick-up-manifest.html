The show has since remained consistently on Netflix's Top 10 list internationally, reminding Netflix executives how passionate the audience for the show is.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: NBC</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Recent developments between Warner Bros. Television and Netflix have led to 'Manifest' being renewed for a fourth season.</h2><p>Series creator Jeff Rake has been passionate about pushing for the renewal of Manifest, starting the social media hashtag #SaveManifest and encouraging actors from the show to help promote the series for renewal.</p><p>He also hosts live-tweets and show scavenger hunts meant to boost fan morale about the show possibly being renewed and highlighting how passionate the fans (or "Manifesters") are.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: NBC</span></figure><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"></a>Finally, on Aug. 28, 2021, also known to fans as "828 day" for the missing plane flight 828 that is the center of the show's mystery, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Deadline</a> announced that Netflix and Warner Bros. Television had come to an agreement and that a fourth and final season of Manifest was in the works.</p><p>Thanks to the show's online campaign and audience investment in the show, it sounds like Netflix has finally made the right decision after reportedly passing over Manifest a few months prior.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>SAVED!</p><p>Who did this?<br>YOU did this.<br>WHO did this?<br>YOU DID THIS!<a href=#>#Netflix</a><a href=#>#20Episodes</a><a href=#>#SavedManifest</a> <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/z7u4yUqRO1</a></p>— Jeff Rake (@jeff_rake) <a href=#>August 28, 2021</a> <span>Source: Twitter</span></figure><p>Although the options of the cast's contracts have technically expired on Manifest since its cancellation on NBC, Deadline also reported that with contract renewal will also be raises in pay, and that two lead cast members (Josh Dallas and Melissa Roxburgh) have already signed on. Other leading cast members are currently in negotiations, but it's anticipated the full cast will return for Season 4.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Couldn't let a day as significant as today go uncelebrated.</p><p>Manifest will officially return for a super-sized fourth and final season, only on Netflix! <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/HGns7vCvhX</a></p>— Netflix (@netflix) <a href=#>August 28, 2021</a> <span>Source: Twitter</span></figure><p>Although Jeff initially planned Manifest to have six seasons, fans hope that this extra-long Season 4 will be enough to give the series the ending it deserves. The fourth season will contain 20 episodes split into two parts, so there will be plenty of anticipation, theories, and of course, cliffhangers.</p><p>Seasons 1-3 of Manifest are currently available for streaming on Netflix, and Season 3 is available on Peacock and Hulu.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfrLatuIynnK2enJ7FbrzInKJmraBiuqK6yJ%2BcrKw%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./maximeb-html.html><span>←</span><span>MaximeB - Age, Family, Bio</span></a>
