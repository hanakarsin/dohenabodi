Source: twitterThe best thing about dogs (and kids, for the most part, too) is that they're themselves no matter the situation.
A dog doesn't care if you're in the supermarket. If they wanna bark, they're gonna bark. They don't care that the leather couch they're tearing up cost $3,000. They don't care that the mailman comes by every day because they're going to yap their heads off to protect their family regardless."><meta name=author content="Hettie Henneman"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>

The dog just went for that calzone. We could all learn a lesson from this brazen desire to get what you want when you want it, regardless of the circumstances. What if we attacked our own hopes and dreams in life like this dog, who didn't care (or know) that he was being recorded. He stole that Calzone right then and there and you know he enjoyed it, without shame. Because he is a dog who controls their own destiny.</p><p>Twitter immediately fell in love with the daring doggo, because honestly, it's kind of impossible not to.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Some heroes wear collars.</p>‚Äî Crowbi wan Kenobi (@Crowesq) <a href=#>September 11, 2017</a></figure><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Sneaky dog üê∂ steals the show <a href=#>https://t.co/R0KggK5rLI</a></p>‚Äî Kween Leah (@Kween_Leah) <a href=#>September 11, 2017</a></figure><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Right under their noses. <a href=#>https://t.co/DBk7tlTm36</a></p>‚Äî Pete James (@theudell) <a href=#>September 11, 2017</a></figure><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>He's got stealth moves.
