I started by sneaking out to go do these things. Luckily I started off as a model. Back in the days before the home video industry, I did a lot of commercial modeling, runways, TV commercials, calendars. So it was way easier. You can go in daytime, do a quick shoot and come back home. And my father is unlikely to see it because he is not in the world of that.</p><p>“But many occasions when I came back late from shoots, he asked me to go back to wherever I was coming from. From all the sneaking out and of course, there was passion. I just knew that I was happy when I’m in this [entertainment] space.</p><p>“And I think what broke the camel’s back, eventually, I tried to read pharmacy but it wasn’t happening then I eventually went into computer science. But when I got to school, there were no computers. There was just one computer in the entire department and that computer sits on the table of the lecturer. So I left because it wasn’t interesting anymore.</p><p>“Then, I took a decision to leave home. I didn’t just pack my bags and leave, it was from all the experiences of ‘go back where you are coming from.’ I started committing more so that me dad would say I should go back to where I am coming from.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpkZH1ye5FrZrCgqWK2bq3BrJqoppSasW6y0aikZqCforJuwM5mnaibpah6sLqMprBmmZOptq%2BzjJyYq52Vp3qvu8ulsLCnn5l6oq%2FTqKlmm5iesap5zKiinqWVZA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./ximena-duque-kids.html><span>←</span><span>The Colombian Actress Has Welcomed Her Third!</span></a>
