The camera cuts from the order to the TikTok-er's facial expression, emoting how she felt about the request.</p><p>Samantha's message read: "Can u make a custom sign?? I want one with a certain saying but can't find it. I can do local pick up." The TikTok-er then asks Samantha what type of sign they want made.</p><p>"I want a round door sign that says 'Welcome unvacinated and unafraid' but like pretty ya know?? Its for my front door and i need it by thanksgiving. How much $$??."</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: TikTok | @thesleepyowlhome</span></figure><p>@Thesleepyowlhome ultimately denied the customer's request and let them know why: "Samantha, assuming you are referring to the COVID vaccine, I cannot in good conscience make a sign promoting anti-vaccination."</p><p>She followed up by stating, "COVID vaccines have been thoroughly tested and proven effective and are entirely safe so there's nothing to even be afraid of. Thanks!"</p><p>The customer took the response about as well as one would expect.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: TikTok | @thesleepyowlhome</span></figure><p>"Um i didn't ask for your opinion i just want you to do your job like im paying you for. or you just cant do customs like you said and are just lieing to our customers or what??

In the clip, the TikTok-er called the customer a "Karen," and many TikTok-ers commented that the woman was acting "entitled" for stating that they were paying the sign maker for a job that they didn't even remit compensation for yet.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: TikTok | @thesleepyowlhome</span></figure><p>While there are plenty of studies that show the COVID-19 vaccine is entirely safe, the CDC has acknowledged that some patients (this writer's own wife included) can have severe allergic reactions from the vaccine, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">including anaphylaxis</a>.
