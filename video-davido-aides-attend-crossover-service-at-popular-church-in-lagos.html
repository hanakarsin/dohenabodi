The viral video of the singer in church has elicited joy among his fans on social media, <strong>Naija News</strong> understands.</p><p>The lead Pastor of the Harvesters Church, <strong>Pastor Bolaji Idowu,</strong> could be heard in the background welcoming the congregation to the year 2024 as camera lights flash and members cheer to the new dawn.</p><p>See the video clip below:</p><p><strong>Naija News</strong> reports that the Crossover Service in Nigeria is a significant religious event observed by many Christians, particularly on New Year’s Eve.</p><p>It’s a special church service held to usher in the new year with prayers, worship, and thanksgiving. It’s considered a time for spiritual renewal, reflection on the past year, and setting intentions for the year ahead.</p><p>Members also attend this service at various worship centres to pray seeking God’s blessings and guidance for the new year.</p><p>Popular Yoruba Nollywood actress, Jaiye Kuti, has debunked reports of ridiculing veteran Nollywood stars begging for financial support online.</p><p><strong>Naija News</strong> reports that in 2023, the movie star made headlines over comments about the series of Yoruba Nollywood veterans coming online to beg, stressing they were giving the movie industry a bad name, which generated controversy at the time.</p><p>However, Jaiye Kuti, in an interview with Legit, noted that her statements were taken out of context.</p><p>She commended the veteran stars for paving the way for young movie stars in the film industry, insisting she would never ridicule or speak down on them.</p><p>According to her, she was only advocating for the need to have a purse for insurance to care for Nollywood stars during their old age.</p><p>She said, “Actually, what I was trying to achieve at the time was for our industry to have a purse for insurance. Our elders have been there; they started this job and helped lay the foundation of what many of us enjoy today, and for that reason, I would never ridicule them or speak down on them. I was only clamouring for insurance to take care of them in their old age.</p><p>“Social media can be an evil, bad place, especially those useless, faceless pages. Trolls can make your life unbearable, forgetting that we are also humans.
