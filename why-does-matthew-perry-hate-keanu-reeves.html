River and Matthew had worked together on the 1988 film A Night in the Life of Jimmy Reardon, and in discussing River's death, Matthew seemed to suggest it should have been Keanu instead.</p><p>"Why is it that the original thinkers like River Phoenix and <a href=#>Heath Ledger</a> die, but Keanu Reeves still walks among us?" he wrote in the book. "River was a beautiful man inside and out and too beautiful for this world, it turned out. It always seems to be the really talented guys who go down."</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Can't stop laughing at the fact that whenever someone dies, Matthew Perry shrieks at the sky, "Keanu Reeves still walks among us!"</p>— Cat Zini (@CatZini) <a href=#>October 25, 2022</a></figure><p>Later on in the memoir, Matthew called back to this moment in describing his reaction to learning the news that Chris Farley had died: "I punched a hole through Jennifer Aniston's dressing room wall when I found out," he wrote. "Keanu Reeves walks among us."</p><p>Matthew and Chris had worked together on the film Almost Heroes, and Matthew wrote as if he thinks that Chris and River had some sort of genius that Keanu lacks. They're pretty brutal remarks, but they do seem to be an honest reflection of what Matthew really thinks.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Matthew Perry apologized to Keanu Reeves after the backlash to his memoir excerpts.</h2><p>In addition to Keanu's non-famous fans, celebrities like <a href=#>Rachel Zegler</a> and Lynda Carter jumped to the Point Break actor's defense. On <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Twitter</a>, Lynda compared Keanu to a "frozen cake," noting that "Nobody doesn't like him!"</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>personally thrilled that keanu reeves walks among us</p>— rachel zegler (she/her/hers) (@rachelzegler) <a href=#>October 26, 2022</a></figure><p>Matthew clearly became aware of the backlash he received, because on Oct. 26, 2022, he released a statement apologizing to Keanu the following day. He expressed his remorse to Keanu and claimed he didn't intend to bash Keanu's life and career.</p><p>"I'm actually a big fan of Keanu," Matthew explained to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">People</a>. "I just chose a random name, my mistake. I apologize. I should have used my own name instead."</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Matthew Perry said he will remove Keanu Reeves's name from future editions of his memoir.</h2><p>On April 22, 2023, at the Los Angeles Times Festival of Books, the 17 Again actor shared that he's pulling Keanu Reeves's name out of future editions of his memoir.</p><p>"I said a stupid thing. It was a mean thing to do," Matthew said, per the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Los Angeles Times</a>. "I pulled his name because I live on the same street ... I've apologized publicly to him. Any future versions of the book will not have his name in it."</p><p>Matthew noted that he hasn't apologized to Keanu in person, but "If I run into the guy, I'll apologize. It was just stupid."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfrLW6ecOonKxlnZbBtbTEsGSpnaKnxm60wK2cZqOVlru2edGenK%2Bdow%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./1248830-halle-bailey-bio-age-height-sister-html.html><span>←</span><span>Halle Bailey bio: age, height, who is her sister?</span></a>
