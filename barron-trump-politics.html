When asked about Barron's selection as a delegate, Julian told NPR, "It signals that they have their eye on the future, that this was not just a one-shot deal. Will there be more Trumps in politics? ... This just adds to that speculation."</p><p>For now, Barron is simply dipping his toe in the waters, with Julian saying his selection as a delegate-at-large is mostly "symbolic."</p><p>But what does the position even entail?</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Barron Trump is going into politics‚Ä¶</p><p>He was selected by the Florida GOP as an at-large delegate for Florida at the Republican National Convention..</p><p>What does Papa Trump say about it? ‚Äî‚Äî ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs cute‚Ä¶‚Äù ü•∞</p><p>He looks so proud of him.</p><p>Future POTUS?</p><p>üé• <a href=#>@KarluskaP</a></p><p>Video‚Ä¶ <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/gffNZS4SSZ</a></p>‚Äî MJTruthUltra (@MJTruthUltra) <a href=#>May 9, 2024</a></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">What exactly is a delegate?</h2><p>Per <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">NBC News</a>, the Republican Party of Florida selected Barron as one of the state‚Äôs at-large delegates to the Republican National Convention. Other delegates who were chosen include <a href=#>Michael Boulous</a> ‚Äî Tiffany Trump's husband.</p><p>To qualify to be a delegate-at-large, per the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Tampa Bay Times</a>, one must be a Florida state resident who is registered to vote as a Republican.</p><p>What you don't have to be? A Trump. Indeed, supporters of the presumptive GOP nominee also include Former Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi, as well as adviser Sergio Gor and former Marvel Entertainment Chairman Ike Perlmutter.</p><p>In total, 41 delegates will nominate Donald Trump on behalf of the Sunshine State at the GOP convention in Milwaukee, Wisc., in July.</p><p>According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Ballotpedia</a>, in total, 2,429 delegates will attend the highly-anticipated convention. Of those, Trump must garner the votes of the majority of those delegates, or 1,215, to win the Republican presidential nomination for the 2024 election.</p><p>Currently, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">CBS News</a> reports that Trump already has 2,010 delegates pledged to him heading into the convention. Meanwhile, <a href=#>Nikki Haley</a>, who dropped out of the presidential race in March 2024, has 94 delegates.</p><p>But as Josh Putnam, a political scientist, told the outlet about Haley's supporters, "It's not going to have that big of an impact at the convention. It's not going to make a difference with respect to who the nominee is going to be."</p><p>The Democratic National Convention, incidentally, will be held in Chicago in August.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfl66zvs6nZK2qpaK9brzOpaCtoZOo</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./1094094-president-buhari-meet-governors-nec-session-html.html><span>‚Üê</span><span>President Buhari meet governors at NEC session</span></a>
