The elder Velaryon seems to have a soft spot for one of the men aboard his ship: Alyn of Hull. The sailor previously saved Lord Corlys's life during a battle at the Stepstones — a debt Lord Corlys doesn't seem quite ready to forget.</p><p>It's clear Corlys feels beholden to Alyn, though it may not be because of his heroic salvation of the sea snake. In an exchange between his brother, Addam, the other brother seems to suggest that there's more than just admiration and respect between the two. Are they related?</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: HBO</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Alyn of Hull is one of Corlys Velaryon's illegitimate children.</h2><p>Children born outside of a royal marriage aren't particularly rare in Westeros, but it seems that Alyn doesn't want to draw special attention to his real parentage. The sailor wears cloth tied around his head while working on the docks, and in an exchange with his brother, we see him shaving off the fuzz growing on his scalp — hair that seems to have a blond hue.</p><p>Alyn tells his brother he doesn't want his men "to get the wrong idea," suggesting that he knows there's some familial resemblance.</p><p>Before her death in Episode 4, <a href=#>Rhaenys</a> also commented on Alyn's appearance, begrudgingly admitting that his mother must've been a very beautiful woman.</p><p>Though it's never outright admitted, it seems that both Alyn and Addam are sons to Corlys — or, at least, that's what the House of Dragon producers are trying to lead viewers to believe. Addam clearly wants for the luxury of the royals, pointing out to his brother how close he could be to it.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: HBO</span></figure><p>"You saved his life, brother," Addam says as Alyn shaves his head. "Do you never think about what could be ours? Or yours, anyway. The riches, servants, the Driftwood Throne."</p><p>But Alyn is insistent that those days will never come, stating, "The Sea Snake would sooner have high tide claimed by the sea than call us his sons."</p><p>In the book, Fire & Blood, both brothers bore a striking resemblance to Corlys, though House of the Dragon only gives Alyn blond hair. Their mother, Marilda of Hull, told the boys that Laenor Velaryon, Corlys's son and Rhaenyra's first husband, was actually their father, though his sexual preferences leave this tidbit debated. As Laenor exited the show in Season 1 following the death of his lover, its more likely viewers will see their connection to Corlys unfold.</p><p>Though it's quickly becoming clear to viewers that Alyn has a close connection to Corlys, how this will ultimately affect the Dance of the Dragons remains to be seen — though with Rhaenyra's plan to invite distant heirs to ride dragons, Alyn could still become a key player in the show.</p><p>House of the Dragon airs on Sundays at 9 p.m. EST on HBO and Max.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfnsBurcuypWaqlaGutbHDZquoZZOkv63F0mafqK2jmnqwsoytn55llKeuqLvN</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./keep-positive-anthony-joshua-reacts-to-oleksandr-usyk-defeat.html><span>←</span><span>'Keep Positive' - Anthony Joshua Reacts To Oleksandr Usyk Defeat</span></a>
