In this modern age, social media is the most used form of communication, and what better way to cut off communication than on WhatsApp. How do you know if someone blocked you on WhatsApp?</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/1120/353cd873fd8f353f.jpeg><p class=align-left>The <a href=#>world</a> has become a small place owing to the recent technological advances in networking. One way this has been achieved is through social media apps like WhatsApp. However, as much as it has its advantages, it has its flaws.</p><p class=align-left>Cases of cyberbullying and attacks have gone rampant and are on the rise. Hence, this has prompting cyber securities to provide tools for one's protection such as blocking unwanted persons.</p><h2>How to know if someone blocked you on WhatsApp</h2><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/e3a882847d8dab6e.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>50+ posing quotes and captions for your Instagram photos</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Ironically, the app providers have disclosed ways to know if one has been blocked. So how do you tell if someone has blocked you on WhatsApp? Here are five ways to see if you've been blocked.</p><h3>1. Check the person's profile picture</h3><p class=align-left>The technique is one of the simplest methods to find out if you have been blocked or not. Though the contact can remove the display photo, it does not mean that one has necessarily been blocked. When someone blocks you on WhatsApp, the person's profile<a href=#> picture</a> or display photo cannot be seen. Besides, updates on it are unchangeable to you.</p><p class=align-left>When an individual's profile picture disappears, it means the contact has deleted the display photo or he has blocked you on the social media app.</p><h3>2. Make a WhatsApp call</h3><p class=align-left>Another way to decipher if one has been blocked on the app is by calling the contact. Since most people on the digital app are adequately connected to the internet, WhatsApp calls have been a favourite. A peculiar fact about WhatsApp calling is the<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener"> difference in the screen display </a>from regular calls.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/84c1bcb936342fee.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=28><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>US Teacher Creates Educational Hip-Hop Songs to Help Students Learn, Retain Knowledge</span></p></a><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/e3a882847d8dab6e.jpeg><p class=align-left>If the individual has blocked you, the screen will display calling rather than showing ringing. It is a fact that most WhatsApp users have not noticed. If the screen display shows ringing, the call is going through, but if it indicates calling, the contact has blocked you.</p><h3>3. Look for the last seen or online timestamp</h3><p class=align-left>When someone blocks you on WhatsApp, you won't see the last seen or<a href=#> online</a> timestamp. The method is easy to confirm if a contact has blocked you but is the least reliable. The contact number can choose to enable the setting which permanently masks their last seen timestamp. However, if this is not the case, it means the presumed contact has blocked you.</p><h3>4. Send messages</h3><p class=align-left>This method is efficient to tell if someone has blocked you on WhatsApp. Once you have been blocked on WhatsApp, any <a href=#>messages</a> sent to the number will be undelivered. Whether the turn-on receipts is on or off, the signature double tick will only display as a single tick. When you come across such, then you've been blocked on WhatsApp.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/672798ebc7bc131a.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=28><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Toxic Bosses, Work Places: Kenyans Share Experiences that Made Them Quit Their Jobs</span></p></a><h3>5. Trying to add or create a group with the contact</h3><p class=align-left>All attempts listed can be due to a simple network error or a glitch in the network being utilized. Therefore, they cannot be considered as the ultimate revelation on whether one has been blocked or not. This method can clear your doubts about being blocked.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/84c1bcb936342fee.jpeg><p class=align-left>Try to<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener"> create a WhatsApp group</a> with the contact that has presumably blocked you. When a notification says you are not authorized to add this contact, it's crystal clear that the number has blocked you.</p><h2>Frequently asked questions</h2><p class=align-left>Dozen of WhatsApp users have been flocking with numerous questions on ascertaining if they have been blocked on the social media app. Here are some of the frequently asked questions on the issue and their respective answers.</p><h3>When you block someone on WhatsApp, what do they see?</h3><p class=align-left>Blocking someone on WhatsApp is a simple method to cut off communication with the contact altogether. When you cut off someone on WhatsApp, the recipient is denied access to previously accessible features. The individual is not privileged to do or see the following:</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/b77049bcccd40ab8.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Squid Game: Top Trending Series Rejected for 10 Years before Making Netflix Splash</span></p></a><ul><li>See your profile picture anymore</li><li>See the last seen or online timestamp</li><li>Send messages, and even if they did, the message remains undelivered</li><li>Make direct calls anymore</li><li>Add you to a group or create a group with you</li></ul><h3>Is there a WhatsApp block checker?</h3><p class=align-left>Mostusers look for apps to aid them in finding out if a contact has blocked them on WhatsApp. Several apps have been developed, but none can indicate who among your contact list has blocked you. For example, apps such as <i>Who Blocks Me?</i> offer information based on the listed techniques to tell if <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">someone blocked you</a> on WhatsApp.</p><p class=align-left>The listed techniques do not offer certainty that the contact has blocked you, and WhatsApp made this ambiguity to protect users. It's not clear to know if someone blocked you on WhatApp. Maybe the contact deactivated the account in the long run. However, there is no way to unblock yourself, and eventually, you will have to meet the person and talk things out.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/698fd424cb77a437.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Kenyans Overwhelmingly Agree Marrying Overly Religious Partner Dims Love Spark in Union</span></p></a><p class=align-left><a id=https://www.tuko.co.ke/351923-how-find-a-specific-person-tinder.html href=#>Tuko.co.ke</a> published another article on how to find <a href=#>a specific person on Tinder</a>. Why would one want to know how to find a specific person on Tinder? Well, the world is like a hamster wheel when it comes to your work life.
