However, there are two clear scriptural instances of pagans celebrating birthdays, Pharaoh‚Äôs in Genesis 40:20 and Herod‚Äôs in Matthew 14:6-12</p><p>-3: The New Testament was written over a period of circa 60 years and no one ever celebrated Christ‚Äôs birth or was asked to celebrate his birth by Christ himself, the apostles, disciples or early church.</p><p>-4: Christmas is a symbol of imported pagan cultures, a subtle indication of neo colonialism and a consequent reminder of <a href=# class=__cf_email__ data-cfemail=abd8c7ebddced9d285ffc3ce>[email&nbsp;protected]</a> day was set aside by our colonial masters, syncretized with the celebration of their own pagan gods. Don‚Äôt we have our own pagan celebrations that we can syncretize, must we celebrate their own paganism? ü§∑</p><p>-5: If in John 8:32, Christ said you will know the truth and it would set you free, why then are you disregarding the truth in favor of convenient lies? ‚óÑ John 8:32 ‚ñ∫New Living TranslationAnd you will know the truth, and the truth will set you free.‚Äù</p><p>-6: Christmas is the time of the year when much alcohol is drunk and many accidents happen, it‚Äôs NOT a Godly festival! Rather, it‚Äôs filled with revelry and wild celebrating.</p><p>According to onlinefirstaid.com:Christmas is a peak time for increased stress and accidents, for both humans and pets. According to RoSPA more than 80,000 people go to A&E each year for Christmas-related accidents and over 6,000 of these need to be admitted. Decorations, fires, new toys, visitors, cooking and houses packed with over-excited children and extra animals present a lot of potential hazards. Factor in the additional seasonal stress and alcohol and you can start to understand how people fall foul of the festive season.-So from those of us who know the truth; H A P P Y H O L I D A Y SüôÇ~FRZ#DaddyFreeze#FreeTheSheeple‚Äù</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWphZH5ze5FuZpygop7AtbnArGShmaNiu7DAx6KloGWkpHqlu4ywoK2gXZi1s7XSrWSdmZSZxm6y0Z6cs51dqbxur8SlnJuqkam2r7OMnJ%2BroaOptqK60mg%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./what-is-a-crossing-below-deck.html><span>‚Üê</span><span>What Is a &amp;quot;Crossing&amp;quot; in 'Below Deck'-Speak?
