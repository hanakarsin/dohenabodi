The <a href=#>Steph Curry</a>-produced hit show consists of various contestants competing against each other on a miniature golf obstacle course — with a wacky twist.</p><p>For most people, being able to win bragging rights is not enough of a prize. But Holey Moley's production team has stepped it up with not one, or two, but three prizes. Of course, one of the prizes includes monetary compensation. So, what is the Holey Moley prize money amount? Keep reading to find out.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: ABC</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-uxeQQ ibmIIm">The prize money on 'Holey Moley’ has increased from $25,000 to $250,000.</h2><p>Show me the money! Avid Holey Moley viewers are likely aware that the Season 1 winner was able to walk away with “The Golden Putter Trophy,” a Holey Moley plaid jacket, and $25,000. However, showrunners have now decided to up the ante.</p><p>According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">ABC 7 News</a>, the prize money has increased from five figures to six figures. “This season, we are stepping it up to give one lucky winner $250,000," Jeanie Mai, Holey Moley’s sideline correspondent, told On The Red Carpet's Karl Schmid in 2020, via the outlet.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: ABC</span></figure><p>Winners will still be able to receive the coveted trophy and plaid jacket, but a six-figure grand prize changes the game. Contestants are even more hungry to win, since the grand prize money is now enough to change their lives.</p><p>However, it’s important to note that not all contestants will have a shot at winning the $250,000.<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"></a> The outlet shares that eight golfers face off week after week to make it to the Holey Moley finals. In the end, only one contestant reigns supreme and takes home the grand prize money.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Kasey Nicholson (@_rezzalicious_)</a></p></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-uxeQQ ibmIIm">Season 4’s fan favorite is Kasey Nicholson.</h2><p><a href=#>Holey Moley Season 4</a> may have just started, but fans are already rooting for one particular contestant: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Kasey Nicholson</a>.</p><p>The Montana native is not only an impressive golfer, but Kasey has an infectious personality that viewers love. The 42-year-old is also not shy about showing off his dance moves.</p><p>Now that Kasey has defeated David, he earned a spot in the finals of Episode 1. But some viewers aren't happy with how Kasey got there. In fact, many social media users pointed out that Kasey’s feet appeared to have touched the water in the Polcano game. So, many people are surprised that Kasey wasn’t disqualified.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>wait, Kasey’s feet touched the water.
