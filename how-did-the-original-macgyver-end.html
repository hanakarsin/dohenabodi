The show ran for seven seasons. For those who don't remember, the '80s original series starred Richard Dean Anderson as Angus MacGyver. He was a secret agent for the mysterious Department of External Affairs. The show's fans loved that MacGyver could take ordinary items, such as a paper clip, and work complete wonders with it.</p><p>In Season 7, Episode 13, it was revealed that MacGyver had a son, Sean "Sam" Angus Malloy (Dalton James). Sean's mother is the photojournalist Kate Malloy, whom MacGyver met after he was in college. During this episode, he met Sam for the first time. At the end of Episode 14, viewers saw MacGyver leave the Phoenix Foundation for good and go on a road trip to get to know and spend time with Sam. &nbsp;</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Could a similar storyline play out at the end of the modern MacGyver series? Could Lucas Till's character find out that he has a younger son or daughter from a mysterious woman from his past? Or will he decide to quit Phoenix and go explore the rest of the world? Who knows! It will be interesting to see what happens to Mac in the final two episodes.&nbsp;</p><p>Lucas took to his Instagram account after finding out MacGyver was not being renewed for Season 6.&nbsp;</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>"The past five years have been what I will look on later as the most formative years of my life. Lots of tough, lots of love," he wrote on a screenshot of the announcement revealing the show's ending. "I made lifelong friends, actually no, family. I learned to push myself to new limits, breaking through and through and through. Was nervous to take up the mantle of an icon and you guys allowed me into your homes and accepted me. I'm like the Roger Moore of MacGyvers now thanks to your support."</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><span>Source: Instagram</span></figure><p>Fans can see how everything unfolds&nbsp;in the series finale episode of MacGyver on April 30 at 8 p.m. ET on CBS.
