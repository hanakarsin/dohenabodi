Star Jones&nbsp;Reynolds</strong></i></p><p>Co-host of the popular American talk show The View started her struggle in 2003. Controversies surrounded her weight loss story. Initially she claimed no surgery was involved, but later it was learnt and confirmed by Reynolds that she had ungergone gastric bypass surgery that caused loss of 72 kg.</p><p><strong>2. Jonah Hill</strong></p><p>He used to play funny characters in teen comedies, and nobody could forget the big guy. But then Hill made a huge difference just to appear in the movie Moneyball (2011), for which he even earned an Oscar nomination. However, the actor quickly got it all back and already in 2013 appeared in the film “The Wolf of Wall Street” with extra weight again.</p><p><i><strong>3. Oprah Winfrey</strong></i></p><p>This Great Woman is usually mentioned in the news in connection with her achievements, shows, earnings… and dramatic weight changes. The fluctuations are believed to be partly connected with thyroid condition. Oprah’s battle against weight has lasted for years by now, with the winner still not evident.</p><p><i><strong>4. Kelly Osbourne</strong></i></p><p>Daughter of rock legend Ozzy Osbourne and also a singer, who was since childhood in focus of cameras, confessed later that she had become tired of always being called “ugly” and “fat” in the media. Thus she changed her image completely!</p><p><i><strong>5. Jennifer Hudson</strong></i></p><p>R&B star Jennifer Hudson lost approximately 36 kg and now can be definitely called not only a singing sensation, but also one of the most attractive recording artistes!</p><p><i><strong>6. Renee Zellweger</strong></i></p><p>This US actress gained weight twice to play the character that would soon become recognized by millions of women around the world, and it is Bridget Jones of course. So after the first series she slimmed down and got plumpy again for the continuation of the movie.<i><strong>7. Mo’Nigue</strong></i></p><p>Reports say that after having been diagnosed with high blood pressure, the American comedian and award-winning actress decided to become healthy, which was partly connected with extra weight.
