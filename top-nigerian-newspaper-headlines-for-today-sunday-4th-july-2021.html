2021.</h2><p>The six governors in the South-West geopolitical zone have convened an emergency meeting on Friday evening over current national issues.</p><p>A top source told Saturday PUNCH that the governors met virtually and discussed issues affecting the region.</p><p>The source could not confirm whether the governors discussed the raid by operatives of the Department of State Services on the Ibadan residence of Yoruba activist, Sunday Adeyemo, aka Sunday Igboho.</p><p>However, it was gathered that the issue was discussed, among others.</p><p>Security operative dispersing Yoruba Nation agitators at Ojota, Lagos State, has reportedly killed a yogurt seller, identified simply as Jumoke.</p><p>It was gathered that the bullets fired by the security operative had severed the stomach of the girl, said to be 14 years.</p><p>She was reportedly displaying drinks at a shop when the bullet hit her.</p><p>Following the increase in bandits’ attacks on public schools in Kaduna, Governor Nasir El-Rufai has secretly withdrawn his son, Abubakar Al-Sadiq from Kaduna Capital School.</p><p>Naija News recalls that Malam El-Rufai strode like a colossus in the company of his wife, Ummi, into Kaduna Capital School in 2019 and enrolled their six-year-old son in the public school in fulfilment of his campaign promise.</p><p>Many observers have now described Al-Sadiq’s enrolment as a “political and media stunt” to give the impression that he is like any commoner.</p><p>It is not clear why El-Rufai made a U-turn as some commentators said it could be due to the widespread abduction by kidnappers in public schools especially in Kaduna and neighbouring states, or pressure from family, or lack or doubts on the capacity of the government school to groom his son as what obtains in private schools.</p><p>Men of the Lagos Police Command on Saturday fired shots at Yoruba Nation agitators who had gathered at the Gani Fawehinmi Park in Ojota, Lagos.</p><p>This was after some Yoruba nation agitators dared the security operatives by spreading banners and flyers to announce their arrival and presence.</p><p>Naija News reports that the agitators were dispersed with gunshots and hot water from an armoured tank.</p><p>Former Niger-Delta Militant warlord, Government Ekpemupolo (alias Tompolo), has issued a fresh warning to President Muhammadu Buhari over the Niger Delta Development Commission (NDDC).</p><p>A board is yet to be constituted for the commission, following the dissolution of the previous one in January 2020.</p><p>President Buhari has since appointed two interim committees to oversee the commission, but they have both been accused of fraud.</p><p>A commander of the Eastern Security Network, the security outfit of the Indigenous People of Biafra, Emeoyiri Benjamin, has revealed his roles in the attacks on police facilities and Imo Prison.</p><p>The suspect also disclosed how he and his gang members fortified themselves with charms prepared with heads of 10 young girls abducted in the state.</p><p>The 28-year-old was recently arrested by operatives of the Inspector-General of Police Intelligence Response Team deployed in Imo.</p><p>Benjamin while narrating his involvement disclosed that he joined ESN in 2020 and was trained in a camp for two weeks.</p><p>The umbrella body of Yoruba Self-Determination Groups, Ilana Omo Oodua has alleged that the Department of State Services (DSS) brutally murdered one of Sunday Igboho’s aides during Thursday’s early morning raid on the Yoruba Nation agitator’s residence in Ibadan.</p><p>According to Ilana Omo Oodua, one of Igboho’s aides identified as Saheed Adisa aka Adogan was shot 48 times by DSS operatives during the raid but none of the bullets penetrated.</p><p>When they discovered he wasn’t affected by the bullets, they smashed his head with a mortar, killing him in cold blood, the group alleged.</p><p>The kinsmen of the Leader of the Indigenous Peoples of Biafra (IPOB) Mazi Nnamdi Kanu, have called on President Muhammadu Buhari to dialogue with the pro-Biafra activist.</p><p>Recall that Nnamdi Kanu was reportedly rearrested in Kenya and extradited back to Nigeria last Sunday.</p><p>He was then arraigned before Justice Binta Nyako who ordered his remand in the custody of the DSS until his next trial date.</p><p>Speaking to Vanguard, the immediate-past President General of Isiama Afaraukwu community, Kanu’s hometown, Chief Ikechukwu Ndubueze, expressed shock over the arrest of Kanu.</p><p>Ndubueze warned that arresting their son would not stop the growing agitation for the restoration of Biafra republic.</p><p>The embattled leader of the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB), Nnamdi Kanu, is said to be suffering from a heart ailment that requires urgent medical treatment.</p><p>In a statement on Friday, counsel to the IPOB leader, Ifeanyi Ejiofor, stated that his client is seriously sick and needs urgent medical attention.</p><p>According to Ejiofor, the IPOB leader was tortured and subjected to inhumane treatment by the Department of State Service (DSS) operatives.</p><p>A chieftain of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Sani Abdullahi Shinkafi has called for the immediate expulsion of the former Governor of Zamfara State Abdulazeez Yari and Senator Kabiru Marafa from the party for contravening the APC constitution.</p><p>He made the call on Friday in response to a statement made by Yari where he opposed governor Bello Mohammed Matawalle, who recently defected to the APC, from being the leader of the party in the state.</p><p>Shinkafi, the immediate past national secretary of the All Progressive Grand Alliance (APGA), who recently defected to the APC, said stringent action must be taken against Yari and Marafa to serve as a deterrent to other members,</p><h2><strong>That’s the top Nig</strong><strong>erian newspaper headl</strong><strong>in</strong><strong>es f</strong><strong>or to</strong><strong>day.
