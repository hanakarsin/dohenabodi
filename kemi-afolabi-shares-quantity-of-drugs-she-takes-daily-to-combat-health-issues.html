We had run a whole lot of tests. Different doctors kept coming, they would ask me questions and I would communicate with them through writing. One of the doctors finally came and he was able to tell me the kind of test I will run. The test was done in South Africa, and it took like two weeks to get the result.”</p><p>“I knew something was wrong because I had 11-15 doctors when they wanted to tell me what was wrong. I even thought it was something worse than what is worse because I’m an actor, so I can actually tell the reactions on the doctors’ faces.</p><p>Eventually, they were asking me questions like do I still want more babies, I said ‘Yes I do’. They told me that there is risk in doing that because with what they are about to tell me I will need to stay away from a lot of things, that my life has changed forever.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpiZH12e5BxZqSdnZ56orLOpZiboV2otaK%2BxKxkqq2Ro8GqwNhmpp9llKfCqL%2BMrJ%2BeZaSWuKa%2FjJ2YoqSpYsGwecKopJuZpGK1pq3LrZ9moaOowqa%2Fjg%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./freddie-thorp-html.html><span>←</span><span>Freddie Thorp - Age, Family, Bio</span></a>
