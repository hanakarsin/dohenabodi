Actors sometimes die or leave the show because they want to pursue other opportunities. Whatever the reasons are, though, it isn't uncommon for a new actor to show up all of the sudden in a familiar role.</p><p>Fans of General Hospital recently went through this with Kristina Corinthos-Davis, a character who has been on the show for more than two decades, and is suddenly being played by a new actor. We have all the details on what happened to Kristina on General Hospital.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-uxeQQ ibmIIm">What happened to Kristina on 'General Hospital'?</h2><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Lexi Ainsworth</a>, who has been playing Kristina since she was introduced on the show, recently took to Instagram to announce that she would be leaving General Hospital to pursue other opportunities.</p><p>"Hey guys, I wanted to come on here and speak to my General Hospital fans and let you guys know that after 10 transformative years, both personally and for my character, that I will be leaving General Hospital," she said in an Instagram video.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: ABC</span></figure><p>"I was looking forward to this upcoming storyline because it was inspired by a personal experience of mine, but I am currently working on writing my own story from my point of view which has been, thus far, cathartic and hopefully inspiring to other women. So, I look forward to sharing that with you guys when it is completed," Lexi continued, saying that she believed leaving the show was for the best.</p><p>"While [GH] has remained a top priority, I have been interested in pursuing new career opportunities that align with my evolving interests and goals, and I’m confident that this mutually beneficial decision will lead to new endeavors where I will continue to grow and expand my talents beyond the industry," she added.</p><p>"But I do want to take a second to address the fans and express my deepest appreciation to you guys who have supported me over the years. Your loyalty has been a constant inspiration and I am forever grateful. The show would not be what it is without you guys," Lexi said at the end of the video.</p><p>After Lexi's announcement, General Hospital announced that Kristina would be recast, and would now be played by Kate Mansi, a Days of Our Lives alum.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Kate Mansi (@katemansi)</a></p></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-uxeQQ ibmIIm">Kate played Abigail on 'Days of Our Lives.'</h2><p>Kate is likely best known for her work playing <a href=#>Abigail Devereaux</a> on Days of Our Lives from 2011 to 2016. She received a daytime Emmy for her work in that role, but left in 2016. She returned to the show twice, in 2018 and then again in 2020.</p><p>She has continued to star in various soaps in the years since.</p><p>Now, Kate is joining General Hospital, one of the longest-running soaps in the history of TV. Kristina has been a staple of that universe for some time, and it seems she will remain one now that she has been recast.
