Keep reading for everything you need to know about Thandiwe and Ol's kids, including their up-and-coming careers in the entertainment industry.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Ripley Parker is a writer like her father.</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><p>Thandiwe and Ol's oldest child, their daughter Ripley, was born on Dec. 17, 2000. She has attended premieres with both her parents, including the world premiere of Mamma Mia! Here We Go Again, which her father wrote and directed. Ripley has followed in her father's footsteps as a writer and told <a href=# style=text-align:start rel="noopener noreferrer">Daily Mail</a> in 2022 that her television show, The F--- It Bucket, had been greenlit by Netflix.</p><p>Speaking to <a href=# style=text-align:start rel="noopener noreferrer">ComingSoon</a> about the film Ticket to Paradise that he wrote and directed, Ol described that Ripley, a budding writer herself, inspired him to write the script. "The movie came out of a conversation I was having about Ripley, who was 18, I think, at the time and starting to make her own decisions — all of which are clearly brilliant and not necessarily the ones I'd have made for her — so it was just that thing, how much do you nudge along?" he explained.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Nico Parker is one of the young stars of 'The Last of Us.'</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><p>One of the stars of the new HBO series <a href=#>The Last of Us</a>, Nico was born on Dec. 9, 2004, and has followed in her mother's footsteps as an actress. Her previous roles include Disney's live-action Dumbo, The Third Day for HBO, and the 2021 film Reminiscence (in which she starred alongside her mother).</p><p>After Nico's film debut in Dumbo, Thandiwe told <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">People</a> magazine it was only natural her daughter would take an interest in acting. "She’s been on endless sets. It’s not that she takes it for granted, but it’s not a world that she feels she’s not entitled to be in."</p><p>Thandiwe also admitted to being very protective of Nico in Hollywood: "She has her mum right there like a lioness checking that everything is looked after. You can’t stop the industry [from] operating the way it has unless the truth comes out."</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Booker Jombe Parker is the family's youngest child with plenty of potential.</h2><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Thandiwe Newton (@thandiwenewton)</a></p></figure><p>Youngest sibling Booker Jombe Parker was born on March 3, 2014.
