Though he's been open about much of his life, there are a few things that he has kept to himself.</p><p>Is Johnny Weir Jewish? The TV personality was married to someone who is Jewish, but did he ever convert?</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Is Johnny Weir Jewish?</h2><p>The figure skater was raised in a Roman Catholic household in Quarryville, Penn. In a 2006 feature, he told The Washington Post that he identified as "a little bit" Jewish. But, he has never officially converted to the religion.&nbsp;</p><p>At that time, the writer also noted that Johnny wore two Star of David necklaces, and a dog tag from Israel.</p><p>In an Instagram post from May of 2020, Johnny's necklace also had multiple cross charms on it.</p><p>Johnny has skated to songs from the 1993 historical drama film, Schindler's List, as have fellow skaters Nicole Schott, Yulia Lipnitskaya, and Katarina Witt. &nbsp;</p><p>Nicole Schott's 2018 Olympics performance to John Williams' score from the film caused a stir online, and many hoped that it would be the last time the music was used in figure skating.&nbsp;</p><p>Though Johnny is not Jewish, his ex-husband, Victor Voronov, is. The couple got married in a small New York City ceremony on New Year's Eve in 2011.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: ABC</span></figure><p>In February of 2012, Johnny told <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">NBC Philadelphia</a> that he was interested in converting to his husband's religion, and that he had a desire to have a bigger Jewish wedding at some point.</p><p>"Most likely I'd convert to Judaism," Johnny shared.</p><p>The couple had an acrimonious split in 2014, and the details of their divorce were finalized in 2015. It does not appear as if they ever had their big second wedding celebration.&nbsp;</p><p>In recent years, Johnny has not openly discussed his religious beliefs.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">What is Johnny Weir's net worth?</h2><p>In years past, Johnny has been open about his love for designer labels and for shopping. Through his past figure skating wins, his sponsorship deals, and his commenting career, the Olympic alum has an estimated net worth of $4 million.</p><p>Johnny also published a memoir entitled Welcome to My World in 2011.&nbsp;</p><p>Dancing With the Stars airs on Mondays at 8 p.m. ET on ABC.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfnsButs6hpaexXayyqr6Mo5ywoaOd</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./219320-this-mike-sonkos-dream-house-definitely-t-afford-pay-it-html.html><span>←</span><span>This is Mike Sonko's dream house and you most definitely can't afford to pay for it</span></a>
