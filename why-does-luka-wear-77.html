So, why does Luka wear 77 on his jersey?</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"></figure><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Why does Luka Dončić wear No. 77 on his jersey?</h2><p>It may seem as though 77 was a randomly assigned numeral, but Luka has made it clear that his choice is an homage to Greek professional basketball player Vassilis Spanoulis.</p><p>Per <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">EuroHoops</a>, Luka revealed his decision to select the No. 77 during a press conference after a 2021 game against Angola.</p><p>"Obviously, Felipe Reyes was my teammate, and he taught me well. He was the veteran over there, and he won almost everything," the NBA star said. "He was a really big time for my career. [Vassilis] was my idol since I was little. I was watching him. It was kind of sad seeing him retiring."</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Luka continued by saying, "That’s why I wear No 7. I mean, I couldn’t wear No. 7, cause it was already taken, so I took 77. He was really, really big time for me."</p><p>No. 7, which is what Vassilis donned, had already been claimed by Kleman Prepelic, an older Slovenian player who had seniority over Luka when the latter joined the national team. Nonetheless, Luka took it in stride and simply added another 7 to his number, making it 77.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"></figure><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Klemen even <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">posted</a> a message of support for his teammate on Twitter when he selected No. 77, sharing a flick of his new jersey with the encouraging statement, "bigtime!!"</p><p>The same number issue arose again when Luka was drafted by the Mavericks, as Dwight Powell already had No. 7, leaving the Slovenian star to select his now-signature No. 77 again.</p><p>Luka has made his affinity for Vassilis known for some time, even <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">tweeting</a> a thank you message to the athlete when the latter retired from basketball.</p><p>On another instance, Luka reaffirmed his love for the Greek athlete by saying, "Obviously, I looked at LeBron, but I mostly watched Spanoulis. I do not know if you guys know him, but he played in Olympiacos," per <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Basket News</a>.</p><p>Likewise, Vassilis has expressed his admiration for Luka's skills and has said that he is a fan of the rising NBA star. "It's an honor hearing one of the greatest players in the world saying that he played basketball because of me. My kids are watching him, I am very happy that I inspired a phenomenal player like him," he said, per <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Basket News</a>.</p><p>It's clear that the NBA star and his idol have quite an impressive level of respect for one another.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfrLW6ecOonKxlnKq4onnWnpirZWds</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./february1-singer-html.html><span>←</span><span>Singers Born February 1 | Famous Birthdays</span></a>
