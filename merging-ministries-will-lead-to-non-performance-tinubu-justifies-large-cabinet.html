Jonathan, his predecessor, retained nine members of the Yar’Adua administration out of 33 cabinet nominees he announced in 2011.</p><p>Yar’Adua named 39 individuals to his cabinet in 2007. In 1999, Obasanjo selected 42 ministers, although he subsequently shed two roles. Before his term ended in 2007, he also trimmed the number of ministries to 20.</p><p>However, justifying his decision to appoint 48 ministers, Tinubu said, “I have had a number of criticisms, including the rationale behind the size of my cabinet. If you want efficient, mobile, and resourceful people, we have to give people a load they can carry.</p><p>“If you combine too many ministries because you want to save money, you will have a future of non-performance and no results. Nigeria needs to turn the corner to grow, and we must give people challenges they can manage, and that is what we are doing.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpkZH1ye5FsZqadopy2r7OMpqCnoaOpv6qx0mauoqScYrmmrcNmq6hlnqS7brzEq52oqp2Wu6SxjK2gp62SqnqrwdKtoJ%2Bhlah6ra3RoJxmm5GXtq%2Bx02g%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./video-davido-aides-attend-crossover-service-at-popular-church-in-lagos.html><span>←</span><span>Davido, Aides Attend Crossover Service At Popular Church In Lagos</span></a>
