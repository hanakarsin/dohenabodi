According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">People</a>, Kourtney's family knew of Travis's plans to ask her to marry him, but none of them let the secret slip. He proposed to her privately in order to keep the whole thing secret until they were ready to go public with the announcement.</p><p>To announce their engagement, Kourtney did what the Kardashians (sometimes) do best: She took to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Instagram</a> to share the news, posting a photo of her and Travis with the simple caption "forever." She then tagged him, just in case it wasn't obvious enough who she planned to spend "forever" with.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Kourtney ❤️ (@kourtneykardash)</a></p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Instagram/@kourtneykardashian</a></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Kourtney Kardashian and Travis Barker tied the knot in Las Vegas.</h2><p>It seems the last thing Kourtney and Travis were interested in was having a long engagement. He got on one knee to officially ask her to marry him six months ago. Now, according to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Style Caster</a>, they are officially married. They tied the knot in a low-key Las Vegas ceremony just a few short hours after packing on the PDA on the 64th annual Grammy Awards red carpet. Travis also hit the stage to perform at the awards show.</p><p>How did the couple keep their major plans so intimate? It turns out they held the super-private ceremony in the middle of the night at a wedding chapel around during the early hours of Monday, April 4, 2022. It wouldn’t be a Kardashian wedding without a team of photographers and security in the mix, so obviously they had their professional entourage involved.</p><p>Since they most definitely had professional photographers present at their wedding, fans are excited for the day Kourtney and Travis will post the sweet pictures commemorating their romantic evening.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Instagram/@kourtneykardashian</a></figure><p>According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">TMZ</a>, they arrived at the wedding chapel with their marriage license in hand. In other words, they certainly came prepared! Interestingly enough, Kourtney and Travis requested an Elvis Presley impersonator to officiate their wedding. They obviously share a similar sense of humor. A source revealed Kourtney and Travis's possible plans to have another bigger ceremony in the future at a later date.</p><p>Keeping things low-key has always been on brand for Kourtney, who openly talked about her desire to part ways with her family's reality show due to the stress it caused her in the past. That being said, it’s not surprising at all that she chose to have her wedding in a quaint Las Vegas chapel. The rest of her famous family might be involved in a larger more high-profile ceremony down the line, but there haven’t been any announcements about that just yet.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfrLWwecisZKSnpafBr7HYZqKaqpSWwKm1wKdknZmknruo</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./2023-elections-crowdfunding-the-right-candidate-for-nigeria.html><span>←</span><span>Crowdfunding The Right Candidate For Nigeria</span></a>
