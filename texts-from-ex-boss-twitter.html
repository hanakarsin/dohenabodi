There's simply no in-between. But for Gracie Hoos, a self-described "amateur funny person," her old boss at a pub she used to work at is somewhere in that middle zone. Over the weekend, Hoos took to Twitter to share a series of hilarious exchanges she'd had over the course of working there.&nbsp;</p><p>This conversation is so hilarious, you'll have to get emotionally and physically prepared to be rolling on the floor laughing.
