The two embarrassing stories have been detrimental to Standard Group's &nbsp;image. The Tanzanian miniskirt ban and the forced Eritrean polygamy prompted the New Editorial Director, Mr Joseph Odindo to do the needful, which saw Ohito being relegated to a lesser position as bureau chief in Kisumu.</p><p>The Tanzanian government &nbsp;was &nbsp;particularly irked by the article which appeared on Standard and the backlash prompted President Magufuli to issue a hard hitting press statement refuting the allegations that his office had effected a ban on miniskirts. &nbsp;The statement required Standard Media to issue an apology to its readers as well as state the new facts as issued by Magufuli's government.</p><p>The falling house of cards was escalated &nbsp;by the recent story run by the same media outlet which stated that the Eritrean Government had issued a decree for all Eritrean men to marry two wives or face jail term.</p><p>The story has since been debunked with a lot of backlash on the Standard which ran the fake story. The story had such a huge impact and was reproduced by media houses all over Africa.</p><p>Men from Kenya, Nigeria and South Africa had even 'volunteered' to travel to Eritrea to offset the deficiency of men that had been widely reported.</p><p>The Eritrean government officials talking to the BBC spoke of their horror and disappointment at the Kenyan media for writing such an absurd story.</p><p><i>"Even a madman in [the Eritrean capital] Asmara would know that this story was not true,"&nbsp;</i>an Eritrean official told the BBC.</p><p>The Eritrean Information Minister Yemane Gebremeskel was not impressed either and expressed his disgust at the negative light in which Eritrea had been portrayed.</p><p>The apparent 'demotion' of the digital Editor seems to be &nbsp;a PR move by the Standard especially with knowledge that a Bureau Chief probably earns the same salary as the Editor or slightly more. &nbsp;An insider at Standard told<i> Tuko.co.ke &nbsp;</i>that a bureau chief makes between Ksh 100,000 to 200,000 thousand a month.</p><p>Quite a tidy sum.</p><p>The only problem with his new post is the fact that Ohito will have to move to Kisumu as he assumes his new responsibilities.</p><p><strong>READ ALSO:</strong><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><p>With the new task at hand for Ohito, it is still not clear what will happen to&nbsp;Frank Otieno who has been heading the Kisumu bureau. He will probably assume &nbsp;'lighter duties' as the bureau is reworked by the &nbsp;'demoted' Digital Editor.</p><p><i>Tuko.co.ke&nbsp;</i> made a call to ascertain the said demotion. An insider revealed that Ohito will be in Kisumu for a month helping raise standards &nbsp;and collecting reports on why the Kisumu bureau is not performing .</p><p>Whether he will resume duties after a month time will tell.</p><p><i>Image:&nbsp;businesstoday.co.ke</i></p><p>Source: TUKO.co.ke</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tcHKqGWcp16gsnCEmG5naWWjqa6vsMCrm6xllZm2tbvRZq6hp12WvbG%2Bzq%2BcnWWWlrimecSroK2qlZZ6sbvLsp6apaliwLW70bJkqa2ensCpscNnn62lnA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./kim-novak-html.html><span>←</span><span>Kim Novak - Age, Family, Bio</span></a>
