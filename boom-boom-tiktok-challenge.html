Whether it's boosting <a href=#>productivity</a>, or visually breaking down the wealth gap between <a href=#>Jeff Bezos and millionaires</a>, there are many eye-opening short form videos that have gone viral for clear reasons.</p><p>Then there are TikToks like the ones of people participating in the Boom Boom challenge.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.distractify.com/data:><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>TikTok's often been called out for promoting an environment <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">where child predators thrive</a> due to the sheer number of challenges that involve suggestive acts, like the <a href=#>toothpaste trend</a>. Approximately one third of all TikTok users are between the ages of 10 and 19, and many of those underage users who have accounts on the app end up mimicking a lot of these popular trends.</p><p>The Boom Boom trend is yet another exercise in sexualized narcissism. In the clips, participants perform a "glow up" on camera that starts with them wearing casual clothing. Halfway through the 15-second clip, they'll snap into wearing a jacket/blazer and no shirt or blouse on underneath. Here are some examples below.
