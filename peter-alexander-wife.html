The journalist has been a fixture on NBC News for years, but much of his personal life is unknown to many of his fans.</p><p>Who is Peter Alexander's wife? Inside his private life, how he and his wife connected, and the family they created together.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Instagram</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-uxeQQ ibmIIm">Who is Peter Alexander's wife?</h2><p>A California native, Peter graduated from Northwestern's prestigious journalism school in 1998. In 2002, he met <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Alison Starling,</a> a recent graduate from the University of Florida, who was also pursuing a journalism career in Seattle. They reconnected eight years later before realizing that they were meant to be. In 2012, the two wed at the Newseum in D.C., an interactive museum centered on none other than the news. &nbsp;</p><p>Alison works for D.C.'s ABC affiliate, WJLA-TV as a lead anchor. The same year she married Peter, she also won an Emmy for her broadcasting work, which was followed by three other Emmy wins.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-uxeQQ ibmIIm">Peter and Alison have two daughters together.</h2><p>Peter and Alison are the proud parents of two beautiful girls‚Äî&nbsp;Ava, who is 5, and Emma, who is 4. Their adorable kids are fixtures on each of their social media pages.&nbsp;</p><p>Though Peter is often working at the Today Show in New York City, he and Alison are based in D.C. Peter worked as a White House correspondent under Barack Obama's administration from 2012 to 2014, and he still occasionally reports as a correspondent.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Instagram</span></figure><p>In a cover story interview with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Washington Family Magazine</a> in 2016, Peter said that fatherhood has enabled him to grow when it comes to reporting stories.

"As for perspective, juggling work and fatherhood has given me a much greater appreciation for all working parents. Similarly, my ability to empathize has grown dramatically since I became a dad. I feel the stories I‚Äôm telling much more deeply."</p><p>He also opened up about living in D.C. with his family, revealing his favorite (and least) favorite parts of the city. "I have a lot of early mornings in this job. Still, I never get tired of driving into the District at dawn and watching the sun rise behind the monuments," he added. "Least? Here, in D.C., you can‚Äôt escape the 24-hour news cycle. Sometimes it feels as though you‚Äôre living and breathing politics or media all day. Every so often, you just want to escape."&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfpbK1sdFmmKWdqJa7pbHRZq6inpU%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./398865-kenyans-react-eric-omondi-band-beca-member-carols-colourful-wedding-html.html><span>‚Üê</span><span>Kenyans react to Eric Omondi and Band Beca member Carol's colourful &amp;quot;wedding&amp;quot;</span></a>
