If the goal is to create a credibility problem, the ploy has failed woefully.</p><p>“Peter Obi has long been on record as the only presidential candidate who has urged the Nigerian electorate not to vote for him on the basis of religion or tribe .</p><p>“We will therefore like to advice our beloved Nigerian people to remain focused on the task to take back the mandate we know was freely given to Peter Obi and Datti Baba-Ahmed through legitimate means.</p><p>“That is more important than to expect those who ran election on forged credentials and even fake Bishops to stop faking.
