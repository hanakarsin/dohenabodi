Let’s dive into the details.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Instagram/@_joshpopper</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Boxing instructor Josh Popper had a brief fling with Samantha Feher on ‘Summer House.’</h2><p>In a February episode of Summer House Season 7, reality star Sam introduced Josh to her co-stars at their Hamptons house. However, the boxing coach’s time on the show ended almost as soon as it began.</p><p>During the group gathering, Sam realized she wasn’t romantically interested in Josh — despite having shared the same bed the night before — leaving him behind to tan by the pool as he sat by himself by the door.</p><p>Fortunately for Josh, Sam’s disinterest didn’t dissuade him from seeking other options. Shortly after the Feb. 27 episode debuted, the former NFL player was reportedly dating a new, high-profile celebrity. So, who was it exactly?</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Josh Popper began dating Madonna after his one-episode stint on ‘Summer House.’</h2><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Josh Popper | Boxing Coach (@_joshpopper)</a></p></figure><p>The <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Daily Mail</a> broke the news that Josh was in a relationship with pop icon Madonna on March 1. One week later, the “Vogue” singer <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">confirmed their romance</a> by posting a photo of her and the boxing instructor locking lips on her Instagram story.</p><p>Josh and Madonna were first spotted together when the reality star shared an Instagram post from his boxing match with the Queen of Pop on Feb. 12. “Another W for the books‼️” he <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">wrote</a> in his caption.</p><p>Since then, Madonna has featured her new beau on her main Instagram feed — with Josh making a brief appearance in an <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">April 18 video</a> where Madonna announced that "Madonna: The Celebration Tour" would be coming to Mexico.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">What does Josh Popper do for a living?</h2><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by King Curated Productions, LLC ♛ (@kingcurated)</a></p></figure><p>In February 2021, the New Jersey native founded his boxing gym, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Bredwinners</a>, in New York City and has worked with several big names. Aside from training ex-fling Sam from Summer House, the boxing coach has reportedly worked with one of Madonna’s children, per the Daily Mail.</p><p>However, boxing isn’t Josh’s only athletic forte.</p><p>A Rowan University alum, the Summer House star played college football before moving on to the pros. While his NFL career was short-lived, he joined the Arizona Cardinals training camp, and the Indianapolis Colts also recruited him.</p><p>However, both teams eventually cut Josh, according to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Page Six</a>.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Josh Popper | Boxing Coach (@_joshpopper)</a></p></figure><p>Madonna’s beau is also a talented fighter.
