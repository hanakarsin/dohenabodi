<span>Lourie Helzer</span></p><h1>Peter Obi Denies Engaging In Vote-buying, Dismisses Viral Pictures</h1></header><section class=post-content><h2>The Presidential candidate of the Labour Party,&nbsp;<a href=#><strong>Peter Obi</strong></a>, has reacted to photos of him sharing money during the 2017 Anambra governorship election.</h2><p><strong>Naija News</strong> reports that photos of the LP Presidential candidate allegedly sharing money during the election in 2017 went viral over the weekend.</p><p>In the photos, Obi was pictured allegedly sharing money to traders in a market even as they mobbed him after he took the governorship campaign to them.</p><p>The former Governor was seen campaigning for the then governorship candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in the state,&nbsp;Oseloka Obaze.</p><p>However, some APC and PDP supporters took to the micro-blogging site, Twitter to slam Obi for allegedly engaging in vote-buying during the election. They described the former Anambra governor as a “hypocrite and a liar.”</p><p>Reacting to the photos, Obi stated that he is a philanthropist and he always shares money to old women in his village when he returns from Akwa, the state capital.</p><p>He denied social media reports that he engaged in vote-buying during the Anambra governorship election, adding that he has never induced voters to vote for any candidate.</p><p>In an interview over the weekend with journalist, Rufai Oseni, Obi said: “You know when people talk about sharing money, I go to my village and I bring old women and everybody and when I come they will say to me, Peter and I will stay there and give them money.</p><p>“I don’t know why I do it sometimes. If I even give somebody to give it to them, you know what they tell me, they will say No no give it to us here. You are a good man, we want to queue up here you will give it to us because when you give that man it will not get to us.</p><p>“And most times I just tell them and as you’re doing it people just picking and they said Yes. So, some of this may happen not that I’m sharing. Ok, they show it in Anambra, am I sharing money to be voted? No!</p><p>“Like when we were campaigning in the last Anambra election, you come to a place and say eh Peter give us something. So you might find a group of 10 to 20 women selling bread and they say Oga Peter we have not sold anything today and I give them 5 thousand Naira. That’s different.</p><p>“Nobody can tell you that he had seen Peter Obi when there are doing voting giving anybody money to vote for him or seeing me with any delegate.”</p><p>See the viral photos below.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.naijanews.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Peter-Obi-sharing.jpg alt width=490 height=680 sizes="(max-width: 490px) 100vw, 490px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/vllkytidij5v0fb2g.jpg alt="Former Governor Peter Obi pictured sharing money ahead of Anambra governorship election" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpiZH13e5FpZmtoYmh6sbHTnqlmp5KeeqWxzaKcrGWVo7Sis8innmahnmLDsMDEZpmusZmjtG6wyKykoqujmsBuwsirmKVloJ6wtcHRnqpo</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./merging-ministries-will-lead-to-non-performance-tinubu-justifies-large-cabinet.html><span>←</span><span>Merging Ministries Will Lead To Non-Performance, Tinubu Justifies Large Cabinet</span></a>
