Economic hardship responds to economic policies, not to protests. You protest against injustice. You work against economic hardship. Not vice versa. If you want your hardship to end, do two things.</p><p>“First, ask your state government to pay you a wage award, support the way the Federal Government is paying federal workers ₦35,000 in addition to their salaries. After all, states are now getting 69% more federal allocation since the removal of fuel subsidies, and their wage bills have not increased.</p><p>“Then, secondly, #GrowNairaBuyNaija. I am looking at the clothes the protesters are wearing. Women with Brazilian hair. Men with imported shirts and shoes. Your clothes are part of the reason you are suffering.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpkZH1ze5FwZp6bn6O8rrXCZp%2BaqpSotaq8jKucrKifo7G0edOoZJ6bn6O8rrXCZqeopJmYtqa%2FjKemrWWkpHqxvs6tnKyso2K8rrvKq6BmqKKkvbC%2FxKxkrKecqsGqu82sZK2nXZa5rbHVopitnV2drrOw0qGgqWc%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./shawn-springs-html.html><span>←</span><span>Shawn Springs - Age, Family, Bio</span></a>
