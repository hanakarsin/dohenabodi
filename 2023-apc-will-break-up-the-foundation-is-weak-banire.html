The foundation of the party itself is weak. We have several people, tendencies coming together to acquire power but they are unable to synergize. Conflict is tearing the party apart,” he said.</p><p>He went further to accuse the party of failing to follow the rule of law and tilting to favour certain power blocs within the party.</p><p>Banire added that he parted ways with the APC after realizing he was keeping a “bad company.”</p><p>Meanwhile, the Deputy Governor of Zamfara State, <strong>Mahdi Gusau</strong> has been <strong><a href=# rel=noopener>impeached by lawmakers</a></strong> in the state House of Assembly.</p><p>The lawmaker impeached Gusau during plenary on Wednesday after the House received the report of the committee.</p><p>The Chief Judge of the state, Justice Kulu Aliyu, had set up a committee to investigate the allegations against Gusau.</p><p>The panel had Justice Halidu Tanko-Soba as Chairman, with Oladipo Okpeseyi (SAN), as Deputy Chairman and Abdul-Atadoga Ibrahim (SAN), Hussaini Zakariyau, (SAN), Amina Tanimu-Marafa, Alhaji Sani Mande and Ahmad Buhari-Rabah, as members.</p><p>Okpeseyi while presenting the copies of the report to the Speaker said they were not empowered to talk about the report with any one.</p><p>He further stated “We have done our duty with utmost integrity and diligence and we have compiled this report based on the pieces of evidence we have gathered in the course of our duty.</p><p>The Speaker of the Assembly in his response to the report said they would work on the report with the context of section 188 of the constitution.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpiZH1ze5FsZmtoYmh6orzCZq6ipJxir7OxwKRkrqhdqbWmecWorKeckam2sLqMoqpmr5WWuG6uwKegq51f</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./what-happened-to-the-kid-from-big-daddy.html><span>←</span><span>What Happened to the Kid From 'Big Daddy'?
