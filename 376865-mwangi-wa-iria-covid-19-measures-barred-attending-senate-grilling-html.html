contamination," </i>he argued.<h2>Arrest and fine</h2><p class=align-left>However, a visibly frustrated committee chairperson Sam Ongeri did not take the matter lightly and invoked Powers and Privileges Act to call for the politician's arrest.</p><i>“In view that the governor came under summons last year, and this year he has failed to honour summons, I order that this committee summons under police escort Governor Mwangi wa Iria to be produced by the IG physically to this committee room on September 10, 2020,”</i> Ongeri said.<p class=align-left>Ongeri also fined the governor KSh 500,000 for failing to honour the committee summons for the third time.</p><p class=align-left>The law gives any parliamentary committee powers to impose fines, ranging from KSh200, 000 to KSh3 million.</p><p class=align-left><strong><i>Do you have a hot story or scandal you would like us to publish, please reach us through news@tuko.co.ke or WhatsApp: 0732482690 and Telegram: <a href=#
