He also has to deal with his own elitism and short-sightedness.</p><p class=align-left>You should watch it because it has been cited as one of the greatest sitcom ever made, and the passage of time has done nothing to erode this. It suits any past and present service-industry workers who have choked on the urge to explode on co-workers or patrons, and frequent travelers.
