We have the elderly in the community who have history and ancestors attached there. So, we cannot be forced out of our ancestral homes when we have a government in the state”.</p><p>The Asiwaju of Isola land, Apostle M A Akindele JP, collaborating the incident, said that the hoodlums came on November 2nd 2021 but some of them were arrested and handed over to the police. He said upon further investigation the men alleged that their support came from Obasanjo.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpiZH1ze49wZqWZnpl6qL7Am5meqqNiwrSxjKiZmquRo7ewv4ynmKadXam8brTAq5isq12qwG67xq6lZpuforq2usitsGg%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./its-always-sunny-in-philadelphia-quotes.html><span>←</span><span>'It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia' Is Full of Hilarious Quotes These Are Our Favorites</span></a>
