But, by the end of Episode 5 of the <a href=#>Netflix</a> dating show, we have five different couples who are ready to leave the pods together. So, who gets <a href=#>engaged</a> in Season 6 of Love Is Blind?</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Amy and Johnny get engaged first on 'Love Is Blind' Season 6.</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Netflix</span></figure><p>We're not playing favorites here, but Amy and Johnny might be the golden couple of Season 6. They get engaged first and, for the most part, they appear to be each other's "person" very early on. Even when they meet with the other couples, some of the others comment on how sweet Amy and Johnny are together.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Brittany and Kenneth only have eyes for each other when they get engaged.</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Netflix</span></figure><p>Brittany and Kenneth are part of a sleeper couple, in a way. They don't stand out from Episode 1, but suddenly, they're in the pods and it's obvious that these two are endgame. Does that go beyond the pods? Well, so far, it has on Love Is Blind. But they have plenty up against them in terms of their loved ones accepting a new relationship and Brittany getting used to Kenneth in work mode.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Jimmy chooses to propose to Chelsea.</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Netflix</span></figure><p>After plenty of drama between Chelsea, Jimmy, and Jessica (and even a bit with Trevor), Jimmy proposes to Chelsea. Is it because he was banking on her being a Megan Fox lookalike, per her description of herself? Maybe, maybe not. But Jimmy proves he is all in when he not only drops the L-word, but also drops down on one knee for Chelsea.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Laura and Jeramey are another Season 6 couple that gets engaged.</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Netflix</span></figure><p>Except for a couple of small hiccups on the trip to the Dominican Republic, Laura and Jeramey seem to be on solid ground once they get engaged. Jeramey does mention wanting to meet Sarah, his other pod romance, at some point. But he proposes to Laura, which means she is the person he saw the most potential in when they were still living that pod life.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">AD chooses Clay over Matthew on 'Love Is Blind.'</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Netflix</span></figure><p>AD and Matthew have a few amazing conversations in the pods. So much so that AD can't help but share the details with some of the other ladies, but it's a good thing she does. Amber reveals that Matthew fed her the same lines, and this leads AD to revisit the possibility of being with Clay. Luckily, he proves himself worthy of her trust, because he proposes to her and she says yes.</p><p>Depending on who you're rooting for (or against), it's hard to deny the drama that comes out of Season 6 not long after these couples exit the pods.</p><p>Watch Love Is Blind on Netflix.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfrLWwecaeq6xllaO0orPEnWSlp6aaeqq%2FjJujoqaUYsCmrdKopWZu</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./food-prices-rise-as-nigerias-inflation-drops-for-fifth-straight-month.html><span>←</span><span>Food Prices Rise As Nigerias Inflation Drops For Fifth Straight Month</span></a>
