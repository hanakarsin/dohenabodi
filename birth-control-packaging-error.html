I chalked it up to Generess being a crappy drug and/or because bits of the stuff probably got stuck in my wife's teeth, reducing it's efficacy.</p><p>But when my wife got pregnant with our second child while on the "mini pill," I was convinced that her uterus was just the fertile crescent, and we're destined to have a bunch of kids. Which is fine by me because I really love being a dad. I mean, I got the horrible jokes part down pat already, so why not?</p><p>But in the mini-pill (it's still crazy to me that these even exist) and the Flinstones birth control my wife's dumb former doctor recommended to her's defense, they were actual pills filled with chemical agents designed to keep her from conceiving.
