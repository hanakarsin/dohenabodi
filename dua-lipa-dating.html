People think it was Callum Turner.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><p>Fans of <a href=#>Dua Lipa</a> are often eager to learn everything there is to know about her. The "Dance the Night" singer has a long list of hit songs under her belt and has solidified herself as one of this generation's most beloved pop stars. As such, listeners are curious to know more about her ‚Äî including her love life.</p><p>The hitmaker went through a very public breakup with model <a href=#>Anwar Hadid</a> at the end of 2021 and seemingly shifted her focus to furthering her career. She was then seen with funnyman Trevor Noah in September 2022. That didn't last long and by November 2022, the "Cold Hearts" singer had moved on to <a href=# style=text-align:start>Jack Harlow</a>.</p><p>Now, it appears she might be dating someone new. Here's what we know about her current and past relationships.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Who is Dua Lipa dating now?</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><p>Dua Lipa is reportedly dating actor Callum Turner. It was during a January 2024 Masters of the Air afterparty that Dua was spotted slow dancing with a mystery man, which people are now identifying as Callum. The British actor stars in the series, which centers around World War II, alongside <a href=#>Austin Butler</a>. Paparazzi was able to capture the singer dancing after security left the door ajar. A source later came forward, telling <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Page Six</a> the two are, in fact, seeing each other.</p><p>Even though it‚Äôs new, the source says Dua also attended the premiere "to support him." Some of Callum's more recent projects include The Boys in the Boat and Fantastic Beasts: The Secrets of Dumbledore. He previously dated <a href=#>Vanessa Kirby</a>. Despite the video footage and statements, Dua has yet to address the dating rumors.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Dua Lipa briefly dated Romain Gavras in 2023.</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span><p>Roman and Dua</p></figure><p>Although the name Romain Gavras may not ring a bell, think back to <a href=#>Rita Ora</a> in 2020 and 2021. Romain was said to be romantically involved with Rita at the time, though it seems nothing more sprouted from that relationship. Fast forward to May 2023 and Romain and Dua made their official red-carpet debut at the Cannes film festival. The two attended the premiere of Omar La Fraise together as a couple. And there was a lot of hand-holding!</p><p>So, what does Romain do for a living? Well, he's actually a French filmmaker and the son of Mich√®le Ray-Gavras, who is a journalist and producer, and director Costa Gavras, as per <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Vogue</a>.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Previously, Dua Lipa reportedly dated Jack Harlow.</h2><p>It was back in November 2022 when <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Page Six</a> reported that Dua Lipa and <a href=#>Jack Harlow</a> were actually a thing.</p><p>If you're a fan of Jack's, then you're likely aware that his May 2022 album, "Come Home the Kids Miss You," features a track titled "Dua Lipa," where he essentially shoots his shot at the pop star. Well, Jack's forwardness seemingly worked in his favor.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span><p>Dua and Jack</p></figure><p>Apparently, Dua and Jack met at the Variety Hitmakers Brunch in Los Angeles in November 2022 and were in "constant communication."</p><p>Jack had gotten in touch with Dua earlier in 2022 to get her approval for his song about her, but it was this Variety event where the two reportedly first met in person and things began to heat up.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>if jack harlow manifested dua lipa, what makes you think you can‚Äôt manifest that one person? üò≠</p>‚Äî taylor tookes || law of assumption¬≥ (@itslitrllymine) <a href=#>December 13, 2022</a></figure><p style=text-align:start>A source told the outlet at the time that Jack flew to New York City to meet Dua after she performed at a Jingle Ball concert at Madison Square Garden on Dec. 9, 2022.

In September 2022, the pair were spotted in Manhattan enjoying dinner from Miss Lily's, a Jamaican restaurant in the East Village. In fact, the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Daily Mail</a> reported that the pair ended the night with a kiss.</p><p>However, sources told Page Six that the dinner meet-up was "friendly," and that the pair "[hadn't] spoken since."</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span><p>Trevor and Dua</p></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Dua Lipa was in a long-term relationship with Anwar Hadid.</h2><p>Before she was seen with Trevor, Dua was in a relationship with Anwar Hadid. They started dating in 2019 and even adopted a rescue puppy together.</p><p>While Dua and Anwar were together, she became friendly with his two very famous sisters <a href=#>Gigi Hadid</a> and <a href=#>Bella Hadid</a>. A source revealed to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Hollywood Life</a> that the Hadid sisters were pretty sad upon learning the news of the breakup in late 2021.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by ÿ£ŸÜŸàÿ± (@anwarhadid)</a></p></figure><p>Per <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Sun</a>, Dua and Anwar's love didn't last due to their busy schedules and the time they spent traveling apart.
