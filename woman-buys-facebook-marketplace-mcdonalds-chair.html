There are many normal products for sale.</p><p>And for many years, one woman who purchased chairs off Facebook Marketplace thought she had really lucked out with her stylish seats. That was, until she unexpectedly found out where the chairs were actually from.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">A woman found out that a set of four chairs she bought online from Facebook Marketplace were actually from McDonald's.</h2><p><a href=#>TikTok</a> creator <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">@martressler</a> shared a video on the platform discussing a set of four chairs she bought off Facebook Marketplace three years ago. She explained that the seller deleted their Facebook page immediately after the sale, which she admitted felt like a <a href=#>red flag</a>.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a title=@martressler href=#>@martressler</a><p>love you @McDonald‚Äôs your interior designer slayed ü´° <a title=facebookmarketplace href=#>#facebookmarketplace</a> <a title=fail href=#>#fail</a> <a title=mcdonaldssecrets href=#>#mcdonaldssecrets</a></p><a title="‚ô¨ original sound - mar" href=#>‚ô¨ original sound - mar</a></figure><p>"But I thought they were cute and I always wondered where they were from," she added, before showing a photo of her sleek, black-and-white patterned contemporary chairs.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: TikTok / @martressler</span></figure><p>After she showed the photo, she revealed that she had found out where the chairs came from.</p><p>"This is what I saw last night at a South Georgia <a href=#>McDonald's</a>," she said before showing another picture of what appeared to be her chairs ... but in a McDonald's.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: TikTok / @martressler</span></figure><p>"It's identical," she said, officially confirming that she had accidentally purchased chairs that were most likely stolen from a McDonald's.</p><p>She ends her video by apologizing to the fast-food chain, claiming she plans to return the chairs.</p><p>In the comment section, users agreed that the chairs were very nice and that it definitely wasn't obvious that they were from a fast-food restaurant.</p><p>Some users also told her to keep the chairs, reminding her that she did pay for them.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: tiktok</span></figure><p>And others used her comment section to spill the tea on their stolen chairs.</p><p>While no one else seemed to have purloined McDonald's chairs in their home, two different users mentioned that they had outdoor patio chairs from <a href=#>Starbucks</a>.</p><p>"My brother and his friends got drunk and stole a Starbucks patio chair. They carried it home about four miles. I've had it for 10 years. It's mine," wrote one woman.</p><p>Another user mentioned the same exact Starbucks chairs but didn't provide any detail as to how they got them.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: tiktok</span></figure><p>And in another comment, one user finally asked @martressler the question I'm sure that we all had on our mind: How much did she pay for these pilfered McDonald's chairs?</p><p>"4 for $100, a steal," she wrote followed by a laughing emoji.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: tiktok</span></figure><p>Well, I guess the moral of the story is don't buy stuff off of Facebook Marketplace. Or maybe actually you should (the chairs were cute, after all).</p><p>Also, fast-food restaurants actually have good taste when it comes to interior design. And apparently, some customers take more with them out the door than their leftovers.</p><p>In conclusion, thank you, TikTok, for sharing all this information with us that we didn't know that we needed to know.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfrLyurc1mma6xo2Kzoq%2FEm6aoo12irrO3xK2npZmTmnqur8OopZqklKh6pLTAoqk%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./1092838-kayayyakin-amaren-hausawa-guda-5-a-shekarun-baya-html.html><span>‚Üê</span><span>Kayayyakin Amaren Hausawa guda 5 a shekarun baya</span></a>
