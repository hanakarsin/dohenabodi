Factor in all of the edited episodes, and some viewers feel like they know some of the players almost intimately. Like <a href=#><u>Ian Terry</u></a>, who has opened up on the show about being on the autism spectrum and has played an excellent game so far in Big Brother 22, otherwise known as All-Stars 2.</p><p>One point of conversation when it comes to Ian is his habit of rocking back and forth when he‚Äôs seated. He doesn't always do it, but for the instances where he has, some viewers have wondered why. Others have simply called for the Big Brother powers that be to make him more comfortable if that‚Äôs what he needs. He‚Äôs basically well on his way to being voted America‚Äôs Favorite Houseguest and the season isn't even halfway over.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: CBS</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Ian rocking back and forth on 'Big Brother 22' has fans curious.</h2><p>Often, when Ian is shown in episodes of Big Brother 22, he can be seen gently rocking forward and backward wherever he is sitting. And, on the show at least, none of the houseguests have asked him why. On the live feeds, however, Christmas Abbott wondered if it was because he was nervous. A fan on Twitter pointed out that it‚Äôs likely because <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>he is on the autism spectrum</u></a> and the rocking motion helps him feel at ease.</p><p>Those who are on the autism spectrum also find <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>comfort in a stimming</u></a>, or behavior that involves self-stimulation. While stimming is something essentially anyone does, from drumming their fingers to twirling their hair, it‚Äôs more obvious for those on the autism spectrum. And the rocking motion, like Ian has exhibited, is a common way to self-stimulate.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>I don't think Ian's going to the wedding <a href=#>#bb22</a> <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/RNF9U19LXw</a></p>‚Äî Tooms (@Tooms_BB) <a href=#>September 3, 2020</a></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">He has opened up about being on the autism spectrum.</h2><p>Ian previously opened up on Big Brother about being on the autism spectrum. It's unclear if it is a diagnosis he received from a medical professional or if he is self-diagnosed, but he mentioned it to some of the other houseguests and had a talk with Kaysar Ridha about it. He also discussed needing access to the outdoor hammock to help calm himself and feel comfortable before the houseguests were given free rein of the backyard.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">There's a petition to get Ian a rocking chair on 'Big Brother.'</h2><p>Because of Ian‚Äôs habit of rocking while he is sitting down either inside or outside of the Big Brother house, fans created a petition for producers to get him a rocking chair. A Change.org petition called <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>'</u><u>Big Brother</u><u> 22 ‚Äî Get Ian Terry a rocking chair!'</u></a> has more than 2,500 signatures. The petition points out that Ian explained on the show he got a lot of flack from people for rocking too often on the hammock back in Season 14 of Big Brother, even if it is the place where he feels comfortable.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>I‚Äôve said this 800 times, but If you‚Äôre going to close the backyard constantly, please give Ian a rocking chair. <a href=#>@CBSBigBrother</a> <a href=#>#bb22</a></p>‚Äî CBS Reality Stan ü¶ñüåö üíï (@Les971) <a href=#>September 2, 2020</a></figure><p>Other Big Brother fans have taken to Twitter to insist that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>a rocking chair</u></a> is one luxury that makes sense for a houseguest to be given access to inside the house. So far, Ian hasn't been given access to a rocking chair, but if he becomes the Head of Household at some point, there‚Äôs always the off chance producers will hook him up. Until then, fans will likely continue to show their support for the all-star.</p><p>Watch Big Brother on Sundays, Wednesdays, and Thursdays at 8 p.m. ET on CBS.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfnq6vecGinmaaoqTBqbHRZqmom5ueu6g%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./rob-gronkowski-html.html><span>‚Üê</span><span>Rob Gronkowski - Age, Family, Bio</span></a>
