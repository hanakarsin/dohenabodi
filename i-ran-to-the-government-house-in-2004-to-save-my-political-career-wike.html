I was to run for second tenure as chairman of my local government (Obio-Akpor).”</p><p>“Now, they were having lunch with her husband and the former State party chairman then, Prince Uche Secondus. And, I was told that my name had been removed on the list. So, I ran down to Government House.</p><p>“She had finished her own lunch, left her husband and was entering the vehicle. I said mummy I’m finished. She asked what happened, I said they’ve removed my name.</p><p>“She ran back straight to her husband and informed him. Her husband asked who removed his name. At that time, Secondus had left. The husband then called the security at the gate, they stopped Secondus and ask him to come back.</p><p>“That was how I went back as second term chairman. For me, I can’t talk about my growth without mentioning her. If she was not around that day, to see the governor, you know is not an easy thing. Her being around that particular day saved my career in politics. And so that was how I grew from there to become what I am today.”</p><p>Wike added that Justice Odili is a caring and compassionate woman who is always ready to help solve the challenges of others.</p><p>“I have seen somebody who is very compassionate, and very caring. The moment you’re around her husband, she takes care of you. She sees you as her husband’s person and so she will always relate with you. Some of us are direct beneficiaries of the care through our relationship with the husband,” he said.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpiZH12e5BuZqJlopa7bsDOZquhnV2cvLex0aeknqakYrWwwdKeZKKmXWd9cYCMraZmq5Grsm652GanqKSZqbakrctmmpqqlZq%2FbsPIpJxo</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./bukayo-saka-equals-special-premier-league-record-after-arsenal-win-over-sheffield.html><span>←</span><span>Bukayo Saka Equals Special Premier League Record After Arsenal Win Over Sheffield</span></a>
