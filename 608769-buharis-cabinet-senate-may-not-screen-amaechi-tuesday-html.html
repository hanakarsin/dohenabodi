We felt that there should be a stay of action on the screening until some issues are addressed.</i>”</p><p>Anyanwu also wondered: “<i>Why are you people al­ways interested in Amaechi’s case? There are other petitions before the committee. We have other ministerial nominees that have been written peti­tions against. All the petitions will be submitted on Tuesday. That is all I can tell you. We are meeting tomorrow (today) to conclude on the final report.</i></p><p><i>“I am sure that by Tues­day, it will be ready. I cannot tell you what we are going to submit to the Senate. There is nothing I can tell you. By Tuesday, you will hear about the report when it will be pre­sented to the Senate. We ought to have finalised the issue by the weekend. But I travelled to my state. I just came back today (yesterday). Everything will be handled all together. We have invited the nominee from Sokoto state. She will appear before the committee tomorrow (today). Her own report will be ready too by Tuesday,”</i> he said.</p><p><strong>READ ALSO:&nbsp;</strong>Ministerial Screening: Why Rotimi Amaechi May Be Dropped</p><p>Supporters of the former governor who are close friends of President Muhammadu Buhari, are said to have impressed on the senators that denial to screen and confirm Amaechi by the leadership of the Senate will be seen as sabotage.</p><p>Seemingly identifying the result of the committee’s probe, Amaechi wrote to the leadership of the Senate counseling it to discountenance the white paper accusing him, saying that it lacked the force of law.</p><p>The Senate will on October 20, Tuesday, commence the screening of the remaining 18 ministerial appointees, the majority of whom were in the second list the president sent.</p><p>Those to be screened are: Khadija Bukar Abba Ibrahim, Claudius Omoleye Daramola, Anthony Anwuka, Geoffrey Onyeama, Brig-Gen MM Dan-Ali, James Ocholi and Zainab Shamsuna Ahmed, Okechukwu Enela­mah, Muhammadu Bello, Mu­stapha Baba Shehuri, Aisha Abubakar, Heineken Lokpo­biri, Adamau Adamu, Isaac Adewole, Usani Usani Uguru and Abubakar Bwari Bawa.</p><p>Source: Legit.ng</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rbHGoqtnppdkg3GElm9wZpqlna6ztdJmmpqamaOytXnSnqWarJViuqLFjKemrWWjmL%2Bmsc1mmKaZlZi1qnnTrpysnJGue6nAzKU%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./323245-trending-celebrity-news-joyce-omondi-kathy-kiuna-timmy-t-dat-more-html.html><span>←</span><span>Trending celebrity news: Joyce Omondi, Kathy Kiuna, Timmy T Dat &amp;amp; More</span></a>
