It was developed in UC Berkely and first used in <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">4th April 2009</a>, to find out how people felt over the legalization of marijuana. The survey site has since spread to the rest of the world. Brands are now using it to get to know what consumers think about their products and services.</p><h2>Opinion Space Kenya registration process</h2><p class=align-left>The Opinion Space registration process involves signing up and verifying your profile through your email. Before you can participate in any survey, there are various categories of personal questions that you are required to answer, ranging from healthcare, research, mother and baby, region, food and beverage, hobbies, and travel, to name a few. Each category has a different number of questions.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/15704375cd8b925f.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=29><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Bolt Food courier registration: requirements, salary, contacts</span></p></a><h2>How to earn and their payment options</h2><p class=align-left>The process is similar to what goes on in other survey sites such as Triaba, Paid Surveys, and iPoll sign up page. First, you have to be within the covered areas to <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">sign up</a>. After Opinion Space Kenya log in, you will receive surveys in your email whenever available. Profiles with a 100% completion rate stand higher chances of getting surveys.</p><p class=align-left><strong>READ ALSO</strong>: 8 online jobs in Kenya that pay through M-Pesa</p><p class=align-left>Each survey indicates a specific amount. You are only allowed to withdraw your accumulated cash after it hits a minimum of Ksh 1200, which you can withdraw via M-Pesa. However, you need to link up your account with your PayPal and M-Pesa accounts first.</p><h2>Is there an Opinion Space Kenya app?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/15704375cd8b925f.jpeg><p class=align-left>Most users have been asking whether there is an app for easy access to all recent surveys.

The motivating thing about Opinion Space Kenya is that they pay their users. It may take a while but eventually, you will receive your payment. The gratitude expressed by some users on Facebook tells it all.</p>"For the first time since I joined in 2017 today in 2019, I made the first withdrawal, and it was successful just two hours, and I got the cash.""#Justbeenpaid! Thanks for your loyalty.""Just got paid, thank you so much."<p class=align-left>The drawback that comes with this site is its delayed payments. From the comments, it is evident that some users do not receive their payments on time.</p>"Pending from 5th march, surely when should I expect this payment??""How long does it take to receive the money after redeeming your rewards? It's now almost two weeks since I redeemed my reward, and nothing has reflected on my MPesa account. Please, I need the money for sanitizer."<a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/ec2728d843bfa31a.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>How to use Betensured to make football predictions</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Another shortcoming that you may face while working with this site is their poor customer care support response.
