If you cannot find means to recover all these veterans’ losses via piracy and exploitation by capitalists, then let them breathe. We new millennium actors are a little luckier but not better.</p><p>“We must learn to respect people’s decisions, choices, and actions. All man for himself. Comparison is proof of nothing. I prefer these veterans’ stars to seek charity than go into drug Trafficking, Fraud, Rituals etc just to survive their present hardship. Maybe these charity should be in a more packaged means because truth be told, MANY OLD ACTORS ARE SUFFERING IN SILENCE AND LIKELY TO DIE DISGRACEFULLY IF THEY DON’T SEEK HELP.</p><p>“Let it be clear, no matter how uncomfortable and displeased you are with someone’s actions or decisions, if it is not against the law of the land and falls within the rights of the person, it is an outright arrogance, crime and grandeur of delusion to attempt to rubbish such person.
