Even if you stay abreast of trending topics or prefer to shift your focus, there is no escaping the controversy surrounding the Supreme Court overturning <a href=#>Roe.v Wade</a>. Many thought-leaders and entertainers have shared their feelings about the decision, and actress <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Kimberly Elise</a> has found herself to be the subject of major hate.</p><p>Everyone is entitled to their own opinion, but your thoughts can easily give you the label of public enemy No. 1. And since Kimberly’s thoughts about the historic decision has rubbed many folks the wrong way, social media has become invested in learning about her private life. So, who is Kimberly Elise’s husband?

According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">FamousStardom</a>, Kimberly married photographer <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Maurice Oldham</a> in 1989. While there is no telling how and when the couple first met, they shared 16 years of marriage together before going their separate ways in 2005. The reason for the dissolution of their marriage is currently unknown.</p><p>Throughout Kimberly and Maurice’s union, the pair welcomed two daughters — 32-year-old AjaBleu and 23-year-old Butterfly Rose.

AjaBleu, on the other hand, has a career as travel and beauty blogger and model.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><p>Unfortunately, two years after Kimberly and Maurice’s divorce, the outlet shares that Maurice passed away due to a blood clot.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Kimberly Elise has received nasty shade online for her views on the overturning of Roe v. Wade.</h2><p>Because abortion rights are an incredibly polarizing issue, people won't hesitate to call you out for your opinions —and Kimberly is feeling the heat.</p><p>On Tuesday, June 28, 2022, the Hit the Floor actress set social media ablaze with her pro-life stance in an <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Instagram post</a> that shared her joy about the overturning of Roe v. Wade.</p><p>“Millions of babies will be saved from death by abortion due to the overturning of Roe v. Wade. Hallelujah!” the actress wrote with baby and dove emojis.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>I didn’t know that Kimberly Elise was so anti- human rights and an anti-American religious zealot.

I praise you, for I am fearfully and wonderfully made. Wonderful are your works; my soul knows it very well.”</p><p>Kimberly’s post has caused pro-choice social media users to lash out online.
