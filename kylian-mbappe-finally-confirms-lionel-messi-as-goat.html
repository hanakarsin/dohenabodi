He followed that up with the UEFA Nations League trophy.</p><p>These two international honours changed everything in the GOAT debate but Messi began to turn the table in 2021 when he won the Copa America for Brazil. The 36-year-old former FC Barcelona and PSG icon sealed it all when he won the 2022 FIFA World Cup in Qatar.</p><p>Messi won the World Cup against a French team led by Kylian Mbappe and went on to beat Mbappe in winning the 2023 Ballon d’Or which was a record 8th of his career.</p><p>Some critics argued that Erling Haaland who scored 52 goals in all competitions and helped Manchester City to win a historic treble of the Premier League, FA Cup, and the Champions League, deserved the Ballon d’Or more than Messi.</p><p>But Mbappe has insisted that Messi deserved the award more than any other person especially because the Argentine icon won the 2022 FIFA World Cup.</p><p>“Messi had to win the Ballon d’Or, he won the World Cup, he’s one of the greatest in history, if not the greatest for me”, Mbappe said as quoted by transfer expert Fabrizio Romano.</p><p>“Haaland had a great season, me too, but next to winning the World Cup it doesn’t weigh much. Leo deserved it”.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpjZH5ye5BwZqSxnJ6ur3nMm5ipqJVis6q6wKWjsmWTpLuntdGmqmakmaS7priMppysq5lirrR5xqiYrWc%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./how-far-ahead-is-jeopardy-filmed.html><span>←</span><span>Here's Why 'Jeopardy!'
