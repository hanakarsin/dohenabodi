It may have something to do with ex-boyfriend Kory Keefer.</h2><p>It is unclear why Sam wasn't featured on the Summer House Season 8 premiere. The content creator joined the cast during Season 7 and also appeared in Season 3 of the spinoff Winter House, which featured her relationship with <a href=#>Kory Keefer</a>.</p><p>Sam and Kory first met in 2022, but they didn't put a label on their relationship until the following year. They broke up in January 2024.</p><p>On Reddit, fans began speculating over why Sam wasn't asked back for Season 8. "Can someone actually please explain why Sam wasn’t asked back?" inquired one fan in the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">r/summerhousebravo</a> subreddit.</p><p>"I kind of wonder if once her and Kory became a couple the network realized they couldn’t have yet another relationship in these houses, so they had to pick. And, due to constant lack of men, they went with Kory," responded one fan. At the time of filming Season 8, Sam and Kory were still dating, so that could be a possibility.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>random but does anyone know why Sam wasn’t asked back to summer house? <a href=#>#SummerHouse</a></p>— realitea queen (@realitea_queen) <a href=#>January 27, 2024</a></figure><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=#>Can someone actually please explain why Sam wasn’t asked back…?</a><br>by<a href=#>u/FlyMissMD93</a> in<a href=#>summerhousebravo</a></figure><p>Another user seconded that thought, writing: "I didn’t like her, but [I] think it’s the couple thing. They want more singles but getting rid of legacy coupled cast members like Amanda and Paige is probably harder than a one season person."</p><p>A third claimed: "I think this is the reason. Sam on her own was a great character. But once Kory was in the mix she was insufferable and clingy, all the things she as a so-called independent woman stood against."</p><p>Others even brought up Kory's controversial political stance, as he was caught following and liking posts from right-wing and transphobic social media accounts. However, there's no evidence suggesting that had anything to do with Bravo's decision to exclude Sam from Season 8.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>You have to hand it to him — he’s putting a little pep into the step of <a href=#>#SummerHouse</a> <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/z66DR9aPuJ</a></p>— Daniel (@idkidk) <a href=#>April 25, 2023</a></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-bTJPMs hHQrGE">There's a chance we may see Sam in future episodes of 'Summer House' Season 8.</h2><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Us Weekly</a> reported back in August 2023 that Sam was returning to Summer House Season 8 for a part-time role. Sam also seemingly confirmed that claim on Instagram by captioning a July 2023 photo "Still giving main character energy." Filming for Season 8 began in June 2023, so these claims were being made during filming.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by SAM FEHER (@samanthafeher)</a></p></figure><p>But in Season 8 promotional materials from Bravo in January 2024, there was no mention of Sam. This leaves us with two possibilities. Perhaps Bravo intentionally omitted Sam from promotional materials to avoid spoilers, or because the initial reports about her part-time role were false.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfrLW6ecisZKyZnWK7sMCMqKVmq6Wiuqa%2BjKGmrquV</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./apc-primary-watch-video-of-how-tinubu-was-welcomed-as-he-arrived-convention-venue.html><span>←</span><span>Watch Video Of How Tinubu Was Welcomed As He Arrived Convention Venue</span></a>
