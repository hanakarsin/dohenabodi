The daughter of Elena Gilbert and the now-human Damon Salvatore, Stefanie is a fan favorite to be introduced in the new season. Since Legacies is really just a Vampire Diaries and The Originals spin-off, it would make sense to add her to the cast.</p><p>Season 2 of Legacies is officially underway, and there have already been some other <a href=#>new additions</a> to the cast this season. Here are the clues that are keeping fans' fingers crossed for a <a href=#>Stefanie</a> appearance this season.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Instagram</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-bTJPMs hHQrGE">There was a brief mention of Stefanie Salvatore in Season 1 of Legacies.</h2><p>There was a reference, albeit a brief one, to Stefanie during Season 1, Episode 10, titled "There's A World Where Your Dreams Came True." Originally, it was believed that we wouldn't actually get to see Stefanie since she's supposed to exist in a completely different timeline, but the mention of her has fans thinking that might not be true anymore.</p><p>It would make sense to add her to the cast since Damon is also thought to be alive and thriving in the Legacies universe. It only makes sense that Stefanie would also be added to the timeline if Damon exists here.</p><p>Ian Somerhalder, though, is not set to make an appearance in the show currently. So if you get Stefanie, expect it to be sans Damon. Ian has been busy working on a series of his own, called V Wars, which is currently in post-production.</p><p>In an interview with TV Line, Ian was asked about Stefanie, to which he replied: "Oh, yeah, isn’t that my daughter?” He gave no indication as to whether he knew about the potential addition of Stefanie's character, but that doesn't mean we're not still holding out.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>I’d have to figure out why a child of theirs would be supernatural and in boarding school. But it’s on my list of things to think about.</p>— Julie Plec (@julieplec) <a href=#>March 29, 2019</a></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-bTJPMs hHQrGE">Writer Julie Plec mentioned that she was considering adding Stefanie to the show.</h2><p>Julie Plec is the writer for Vampire Diaries, The Originals, and Legacies, so if anyone would know if there was the possibility of making Stefanie a cast member, it would be her.</p><p>And when <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">asked</a> by a fan, she admitted that she would think about it.</p><p>"Has there been any thought about having Damon and Elena’s kids on Legacies?" Twitter use @jamdee01 tweeted at Julie back in March. To which, Julie replied "I'd have to figure out why a child of theirs would be supernatural and in boarding school. But it's on my list of things to think about."</p><p>Meaning, yes, she's thought about the possibility of it. And we're really hoping she'll think of a way to add her.</p><p>The reason it currently wouldn't make sense for Stefanie to attend the Salvatore School for the Young and Gifted is because at the end of Vampire Diaries, Damon was able to reverse his vampire-state, making him human again. This is how he and Elena got their happily ever after, and when they started having children. So, logically, a child of theirs would be human.</p><p>But, it's a fantasy world, so of course there are ways to bend those rules.</p><p>Regardless, there's still a chance that we'll get to see Stefanie added to the cast. How, exactly, we're not quite sure yet, but at least a brief cameo, if not an addition as a series regular, would help fill the hole Vampire Diaries left in our hearts.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfqMGmssCnoJ5lo5a5t63TqKmeZZyatKKvyJ6q</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./309469-dennis-itumbi-arrested-dp-rutos-assassination-claims-letter-html.html><span>←</span><span>Dennis Itumbi arrested over letter linked to DP Ruto's alleged assassination plot</span></a>
