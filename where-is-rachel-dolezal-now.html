She had straight, blonde hair and blue eyes. According to her brother Ezra, Dolezal began perming her hair and darkening her skin in order to pass herself off as being Black. Ezra says she warned him, “<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Don’t blow my cover.</u></a>”</p><p>In 2014, Dolezal was successfully passing as a Black woman. She was even elected president of the Spokane, Wash. chapter of the NAACP and was praised for revitalizing it. But it all came crashing down in 2015 when her parents revealed that she was lying about her race, and was actually white. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Where is Rachel Dolezal now</u></a>?</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Instagram</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Where is Rachel Dolezal now?</h2><p>In the midst of the controversy surrounding Dolezal’s racial identity, she resigned from her position at the NAACP. She was also removed from her position as chair of the Office of the Police Ombudsman Commission in Spokane after an investigation concluded she had engaged in “a pattern of misconduct.” The Pacific Northwest Inlander — a publication to which Dolezal had contributed —&nbsp;cut ties with her as well, saying they felt they had been “manipulated and deceived.”</p><p>However, despite the controversy (which received national attention), Dolezal has never backed down on her claims that she is a Black woman. She has admitted that she was “biologically born to white parents,” but says that she sees race as a social construct and therefore <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>self-identifies as Black</u></a>.</p><p>In the years since, Dolezal has released a memoir about her racial identity entitled In Full Color: Finding My Place in a Black and White World. In it, she writes about how she considered herself to be Black even in early childhood —&nbsp;and even though she didn’t meet an actual Black person until she was 10 years old. At the age of 17, she had the opportunity to spend her summer break working for a family friend’s greeting card company</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="margin:8px 0 0;padding:0 4px"><a href=# style=color:#000;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none;word-wrap:break-word>Getting ready to ship out another autographed copy of my book, “In Full Color.” Thanks to everyone who has recently ordered a copy of my book!

Dolezal had to repay the welfare funds and perform community service.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="margin:8px 0 0;padding:0 4px"><a href=# style=color:#000;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none;word-wrap:break-word>Just a reminder that many of my original paintings are on CLEARANCE sale prices through April!
