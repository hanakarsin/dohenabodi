Our professionals no longer base their arguments and actions on facts and stats but are driven by greed, tribalism and political inclinations. They will shamelessly distort facts to suit their selfish agenda regardless of the repercussions of their action.</p><p class=align-left>Our religious leaders are no longer guided by “roho mtakatifu” (Holy Spirit) but by “roho mtakakitu”.

They have no one to trust with their lives or wellbeing.</p><p class=align-left>Distrust does not happen overnight. It develops progressively through stages, especially after one discovers that the other party lied to them on a certain matter or issue. The experiences we go through with other people and especially those entrusted with leadership positions in any field of life impact our ability to trust others.</p><p class=align-left>Past disappointments or betrayals are at the root of this issue because mistrust is a valid response to feeling betrayed.</p><p class=align-left>Financial and economic challenges also lead to a significant loss of trust in the government. There is flagrant dishonesty among those we have entrusted with leadership positions. Many of them would rather take shortcuts or make populist interventions that eventually lead to even more problems and distrust.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/ad5c5bc5f04b1f7c.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Award winning education reporter Makori Ongechi leaves Citizen TV</span></p></a><p class=align-left>This is a great predicament as low trust in those in leadership positions makes it harder to solve many of the country’s problems.</p><p class=align-left>A decline in trust leads to lower rates of compliance with <a href=#>rules and regulations.</a> It makes citizens become more risk-averse, thus delaying investment, innovation and employment decisions that are essential to regain competitiveness and spur growth.</p><p class=align-left>Is there a way to address the erosion of trust? Definitely yes.</p><p class=align-left>The best way to prevent distrust from taking root is by proactively focusing on building trust. Trust must be continually developed and nurtured; not just when it is at risk.</p><p class=align-left>Trust in government by citizens is essential for effective and efficient policymaking. Those in leadership should invest in trust in order to reinforce social cohesion and restore economic growth.</p><p class=align-left>Professionals must only be guided by the desire for service delivery and integrity. Rather than being merchants of misery, the clergy should sincerely take up their cardinal role of being the “good shepherds” and inspire hope in their flock.
