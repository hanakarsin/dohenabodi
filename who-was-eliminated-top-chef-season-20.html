He won back-to-back Top Chef seasons. Season 19 of the show (Top Chef: Houston) also left Buddha as the winner.</p><p>Buddha was raised in Australia, but he followed his culinary dreams all the way to London before heading to New York City.</p><p>In the final episode, Buddha worked with previously eliminated Chef Ali Ghzawi. Under Buddha's lead, they created a four-course meal that impressed the judges.</p><p>The meal had to be progressive in nature. Buddha started the judges off with rainbow trout and kept the seafood idea rolling with a blue lobster next. His third course deviated a little. He served the judges a lamb and roasted eggplant.</p><p>Buddha's victory meal was wrapped up with his dessert: a coconut, raspberry, and chocolate lamington.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Bravo</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Who was eliminated from 'Top Chef' Season 20?</h2><p>Here's everyone who has been eliminated so far on Top Chef Season 20:</p><ul><li><strong>Episode 1:</strong> Samuel Albert (Top Chef: France Season 10 winner)</li><li><strong>Episode 2:</strong> Dawn Burrell (Top Chef: Portland finalist)</li><li><strong>Episode 3: </strong>Dale MacKay (Top Chef: Canada Season 1 winner) and May Phattanant Thongthong (Top Chef: Thailand Season 1 finalist)</li><li><strong>Episode 4: </strong>Luciana Berry (Top Chef: Brazil Season 2 winner)</li><li><strong>Episode 5:</strong> Begoña Rodrigo (Top Chef: Spain Season 1 winner)</li><li><strong>Episode 6: </strong>Sylwia Stachyra (Top Chef: Poland Season 7 winner</li><li><strong>Episode 7:</strong> Dale MacKay (Top Chef: Canada Season 1 winner)</li><li><strong>Episode 8</strong>: Charbel Hayek (Top Chef: Saudi Arabia Season 5 winner)</li><li><strong>Episode 9:</strong> Nicole Gomes (Top Chef: Canada Season 5 winner)</li><li><strong>Episode 10:</strong> Victoire Gouloubi (Top Chef: Italy Season 2 finalist)</li><li><strong>Episode 11:</strong> Amar Santana (Top Chef California Season 13 finalist) and Sara Bradley (Top Chef Season 16 finalist)</li><li><strong>Episode 12:</strong> Tom Goetter (Top Chef Germany Season 1 finalist)</li><li><strong>Episode 13:</strong> Ali Ghzawi (Top Chef Middle East & North Africa Season 3 winner)</li></ul><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-dTSxUT dyQypj"></figure><p>Buddha will be getting the $250,000 prize, along with a feature in Food & Wine magazine and an appearance at the 40th annual Food & Wine Classic in Aspen.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfrLWwedaaqmadnJ66qrrArZydZaSkvW6vx56dZquVlsCwuoxrZw%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./mitch-tummel-html.html><span>←</span><span>Mitchel Scott - Age, Family, Bio</span></a>
