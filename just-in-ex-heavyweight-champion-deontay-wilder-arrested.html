Naija News learnt that the 37-year-old was apprehended on Tuesday over alleged possession of a gun following a routine traffic stop in Los Angeles.
Officers were reportedly observing their routine work in Hollywood at around 1:15 a.m. when they observed that Wilder’s Rolls-Royce has illegally tinted windows and was obstructing the license plate.
Again the officers claimed to have smelled an odour of burnt marijuana during the stop, which prompted them to search the boxer’s car."><meta name=author content="Almeda Bohannan"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>
