Posterity will certainly be kind to him.</p><p>“The good people of Lagos State definitely prefer Governor Sanwo-Olu to build on his achievements in the second term rather than experiment with a neophyte. Lagos does not need a breath of foul air.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpiZH5xe5ByZrChm5rAbrHNnaarq5Wisq%2FAjKidZquRo8Swec6lrGaikaOxsL6Mn6muq6SnrrWxw2aYp5xdmbK0vMSrmK2dXaGuqLvSZpipm18%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./375089-orodha-ya-makamishna-21-waliohamishwa-na-walioteuliwa-html.html><span>←</span><span>Orodha ya makamishna 21 waliohamishwa na walioteuliwa</span></a>
