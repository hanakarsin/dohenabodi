So, for me, I am the candidate. Though the case is still in court and ongoing, I’m still the candidate,” she said.</p><p>“I haven’t been expelled from the party. You and I know that to expel a person, that person has to be informed but I haven’t been informed. It was supposed to have come in writing, letting me know about the offences.</p><p>“And I should be able to respond. It is consequent on my response that I will be invited by a committee to look at those issues before a committee is taken.</p><p>“I also did not sign any letter of withdrawal also, I didn’t know where they got it from. I also didn’t lie in court and that’s up for the court to decide.”</p><p><strong>Naija News</strong> recall that on July 22, a Federal High Court in Abakaliki dismissed a suit filed by Umahi, asking the court to recognise him as the APC candidate for the senatorial district.</p><p>However, the court recognised Agom-Eze, who came second in the May 28 senatorial primary election for Ebonyi south, but ordered that a fresh primary election be conducted within 14 days.</p><p>The APC conducted a fresh primary election on July 31, and Umahi was declared the winner.</p><p>Following this development, the Ebonyi chapter of the party announced the expulsion of Agom-Eze from the party for “rebelliously jeopardising her membership by violating APC’s constitution”.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpiZH15e5FtZmtoYmh6qnnHmq2epqRir6axzWacsaiVobmmsIyfqailXZa9pHnAp6VmmZekum6x2Z5m</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./the-skorys-html.html><span>←</span><span>The Skorys - Members, Ages, Trivia</span></a>
