So, who is returning to ‘CSI: Vegas'? Here are the deets.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: CBS</span></figure><p>We were promised a new sequel to our favorite procedural forensic drama show, and the day has finally come. Fans were thrilled with the news and eager to see how the show would reboot. So, who is returning to <a href=#>CSI: Vegas</a> from the original series? Here’s what we know so far.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Who is returning to ‘CSI: Vegas'?</h2><p>When our favorite show goes off the air — especially if we’ve been blessed with several seasons — it’s not easy to say goodbye. For fans of the uber-popular CSI: Crime Scene Investigation, they had storyline after storyline for 15 years before the show went off the air.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: CBS</span></figure><p>And the show was at the top of the ratings game for over a decade, launching a television franchise that began a whole new genre of television. And people clearly loved what they were seeing. There were several spinoffs following the same format but in a different city or a different investigative unit.</p><p>Now, fans who have been missing the original feel of CSI are crying tears of joy. On March 31, word was made official when <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Deadline</a> reported a new sequel of the popular show from the early 2000s.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: CBS</span></figure><p>The first episode of the new show began airing on CBS on Oct. 6, 2021, and not only are we getting back to the old stopping ground of Vegas, but there are also some familiar faces returning too.</p><p>The original leader of the forensic detectives, Gil Grissom, played by William Petersen, will be reprising his role for CSI: Vegas. William was a part of the show for nine seasons between 2000 and 2010, choosing to leave at the completion of Season 9.</p><p>Jorja Fox, who played Sara Sidle, another major character on the series, is returning for the new show as well. Her character’s storyline was a part of close to 300 episodes, and it would be hard to see another Vegas-location CSI series without her in it.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by CSI: Vegas (@csicbs)</a></p><span>Source: Instagram</span></figure><p>In addition, David Hodges’ character, played by Wallace Langham, has also been confirmed to be involved in the storyline of CSI: Vegas. Wallace joined the series late into Season 3 as a recurring character until Season 7. When Season 8 began in 2008, Wallace became a main fixture in the show.</p><p>The fourth person who was a mainstay on the original show that’s making a return in the new spinoff is Paul Guilfoyle, who portrayed Jim Brass. Though he’s not going to be a main character in the new show, he’s been <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">confirmed</a> as returning for at least two episodes.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: CBS</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Who are the new main characters in ‘CSI: Vegas'?</h2><p>Of course, with a new show comes some new characters who will be joining the seasoned experts. New regulars include Maxine Roby (Paula Newsome), the new head of the crime lab, and Joshua Folsom (Matt Lauria), a Level III CSI who is typically the lead investigator on cases.</p><p>Two other new characters heading to the CSI: Vegas team also include Hugo Ramirez (Mel Rodriguez), the head medical examiner, and Allie Rajan (Mandeep Dhillon), a Level II CSI who is an immigrant who followed her dreams to Las Vegas.</p><p>CSI: Vegas airs on Wednesdays at 10 p.m. EST on CBS.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfrLWwecisZKudpKq%2Fr7XNoGStp12YwKp51Z6emqs%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./onlyfans-banning-content.html><span>←</span><span>OnlyFans Is No Longer Banning Sexually Explicit Content</span></a>
