We also thanked the President for supporting them to deliver on their mandate.</p><p>“I also explained yesterday that the Progressive Governors’ Forum discussed the issue of national convention of the party and they mandated us to come and discuss with the President as the party’s leader to give the input of the governors so that the party and the President will consider.</p><p>“Part of the inputs we got yesterday was that we still have four states, which are in the process of completing their congresses like Anambra; understandably because of the recent gubernatorial election, Zamfara and two others, because of logistic challenges and then, <a href=# rel=noopener><strong>Christmas</strong></a> is around the corner and early January we will be very busy with Ekiti.</p><p>“So, the governors, based on all these, suggested the party and the President should graciously consider February and the President is favourably disposed to the suggestion.”</p><p>Speaking further on the outcome of their meeting on Monday, Yobe State Governor said: “The Progressive Governors’ Forum, after their meeting, has suggested February to the party and the President has concurred. So, we are going ahead to plan for the convention in February.</p><p>“Nigerians should expect more unity and progress as a result of the forthcoming convention.”</p><p>Reacting to insinuations in some quarters that the convention is probably delayed to extend his tenure as the caretaker chairman of the APC, Buni said: “Am I a jobless person who is always trying to extend his tenure? To do what? I have my primary responsibility as a governor to go back to my state and carry out my primary responsibility.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWphZH5ye5FsZpqok2K0qsLErGSrnZGovK951qGwZqGkqHqvrdOipqeZnGKwsLrVnqWtoZ%2BjeqStza1koaecmXqquoxrZ2toXw%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./suitcase-of-diet-coke.html><span>←</span><span>Woman Packs Suitcase of Diet Coke to Take Overseas</span></a>
