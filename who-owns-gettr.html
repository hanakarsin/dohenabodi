Here's what we know about the brand new app and who's behind it. Details inside.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Gettr</span></figure><p>There may come a time in the distant future where people are going to forget that there once was a businessman turned reality TV show host, who utilized a social media platform to troll himself into what is arguably the most powerful job in the world. And once <a href=#>Donald Trump</a> neared the end of his presidency, Twitter deactivated his account and seemed to send him into obscurity.</p><p>So when Team Trump announced its launch of Twitter alternative, <a href=#>Gettr</a>, people wanted to know who actually owns the app.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Who owns Gettr? All signs point to former Trump spokesman Jason Miller.</h2><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Politico</a> reports that Miller "is leading the platform" and that he's also enlisted the help of another former campaign spokesperson, Tim Murtaugh, who is consulting on the application as well.</p><p>Gettr's announcement has been a long time coming, with many people labeling the app as basically Trump's version of Twitter, but it's unclear whether or not the former president has any actual affiliation with Gettr.</p><p>A rep affiliated with the app said, "The former president is going to make his own decision. It’s certainly there and ready for him should he make the decision — we would welcome that. There is an account reserved for him and waiting for him but that’s a decision for him to make."</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Google Play Store</span></figure><p>Both Trump's Twitter and Facebook privileges have been revoked, so he attempted to communicate with his user base via his From the Desk of Donald J. Trump blog, but website issues and low readership led to the blog ultimately being shut down.</p><p>There were rumors that Trump would be using Gettr as a communication platform, but it seems that the former president is waiting to see if the application has any sort of viable user base on it.</p><p>It's important to note that a key strategy of Trump's to winning the presidency was to say outlandish things that would ruffle people's feathers. His outlandish claims would get publicity, people would throw fits, Saturday Night Live would lampoon him, dozens of media articles would ridicule him, and Trump would lap up the publicity and throw in some criticism of "liberals" and the "radical left," and the cycle would continue.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Me on twitter vs Me on <a href=#>#GETTR</a></p><p>Thank you <a href=#>@JasonMillerinDC</a> <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/VWnkfQd5tf</a></p>— Smith Jameson (@SmithJamesonFTI) <a href=#>July 7, 2021</a></figure><p>The social media castration of Trump effectively rendered this strategy nonviable, and for him to attempt a Gettr launch at this point is a tricky move. It has nowhere near the reach of Twitter, and it would be clear that Trump is joining the platform just so people will listen to him again.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">But Gettr is already experiencing some drama, even without Trump on board.</h2><p>The application has already seen a litany of security issues and spam and bot accounts flooding the platform, which is reportedly making any type of positive user experience unattainable.</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">TechCrunch</a> reported that some 85,000 users had their email addresses and other personal information like birthdays hacked because of poor security protocols. Plus there's the litany of spam and pornography-themed accounts flooding the app.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>gettr being overrun with sonic the hedgehog p0rn is exactly the way i want the 4th of july weekend to start. god bless and hallelujah</p>— schrodinger's thot experiment (@sinnohlakes) <a href=#>July 3, 2021</a></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">What is Gettr?</h2><p>Part of the app's mission statement reads: "Fighting cancel culture, promoting common sense, defending free speech, challenging social media monopolies, and creating a true marketplace of ideas." But now they may find themselves having to crack down on specific accounts and police messages on the platform.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>QAnon fans were initially excited about new MAGA social app Gettr, but they're growing irate as moderators fail to keep lewd anime pics and the "pig poop balls" meme out of the QAnon hashtag.

Seems like their mission might be backfiring in a very real way.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfrLWwec6wpaxll5rBtb4%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./darude-html.html><span>←</span><span>Darude - Age, Family, Bio</span></a>
