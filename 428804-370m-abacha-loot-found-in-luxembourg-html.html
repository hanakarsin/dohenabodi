We will help this government.</p><p><i>“If you remember, many years ago, we gave back the Abacha money to Nigeria. The situation in Switzerland has changed. The policy is no longer the same. In the past, people come to deposit money in Switzerland without too much controversy. Now, it is not possible to deposit money in Switzerland because of legal origin.</i></p><p><i>“Before now, the bank has to prove that the money is legal. But now, before you deposit money in any Swiss bank, you have to prove that you have earned that money legally.</i></p><p><i>“If you are a wealthy businessman, you have money in billions legally, but if, for example as a journalist, you come to Switzerland with two million dollars and say you earned it because you did a very good job, nobody will believe you.”</i></p><p><strong>READ ALSO:&nbsp;</strong><a href=#>Read What Fayose Wants Nigerians To Do To Obasanjo Over Military Coup Rumour</a></p><p>The Ambassador said the Nigerian government and the Abacha family have sought legal assistance from the Swiss government to enable them retrieve the money, pointing out that Swiss government has offered the legal assistance.</p><p>He said further that his government is directly involved since the money is not in a Swiss bank.</p><p>On what he discussed with Buhari, he said <i>“Even if the relation is perfect there is always room for improvement.
