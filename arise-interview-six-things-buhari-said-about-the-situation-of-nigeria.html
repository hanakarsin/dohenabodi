We’ll organise the police and the military to pursue them.”</p><p>There is a need to keep an eye on what the president’s remarks will mean, especially considering how the international community has written to him on the issue in the past.</p><h2>Banditry in the Northeast</h2><p>The President said he has given the military and the police the order to “be ruthless” against bandits terrorising the north-west region of the country.</p><p>“Problem in the north-west; you have people over there stealing each other’s cattle and burning each other’s villages. Like I said, we are going to treat them in the language they understand. We have given the police and the military the power to be ruthless. You watch it in a few weeks’ time there will be difference.”</p><h2>When will he reconcile with Twitter?</h2><p>Asked when the ban on Twitter in the country would be lifted, President Buhari said he would not comment on the issue, although he replied: “Twitter? That I will keep to myself” Then he smiled and pulled his mouth shut.</p><h2>On life after presidency</h2><p>Another question that was asked of President Muhammadu Buhari was what he would focus on when his tenure ends as the president of Nigeria.</p><p>The president replied, “As you know, I have a farm and I have cattle, so I will go there every day, and I will find a lot of things to keep myself occupied.”</p><p>But he said in the meantime he would focus on improving three issues related to security, the economy and major projects.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWphZH13e5BpZpqqmaiybrXNrZyrrpmaxG6%2FyLFkraCZo7S0ecGun5qqmWLAorXDZpibp6WperW0xGaqoqyllsGqu81mpp9lnp60pr7ImmY%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./free-mcdonalds-fries-tiktok-hack.html><span>←</span><span>Score Free McDonald's Fries With This TikTok Hack Find out How!</span></a>
