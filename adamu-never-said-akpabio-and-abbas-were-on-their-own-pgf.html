Until we formally resolve and communicate with them in writing which is the norm and practice, it is not our intention to break away from traditions.</p><p>“So, whatever announcement is done by either the President of the Senate, Deputy Senate President, Speaker or Deputy Speaker, is not from this secretariat.”</p><p>But the governors believed Adamu’s action was a result of a communication gap between the party and the party’s high-ranking legislators.</p><p>Speaking with pressmen after they met with the NWC, the PGF Chairman and Governor of Imo State, <a href=# rel=noopener>Hope Uzodinma</a>, said the PGF will resolve the conflict with the aid of the APC internal mechanism.</p><p>He submitted that “Don’t let us misquote him. The chairman never said that they (Akpabio and Abbas) are on their own. The National Assembly leadership belongs to our great party and they enjoy our support.</p><p>“If there is a communication gap anywhere, we will make it up. We have our internal mechanism for resolving such things. The National Assembly leadership enjoys the support of the Progressives Governors Forum and our party. We don’t have any problem at all.</p><p>“We congratulated ourselves in the way and manner the leadership of the National Assembly election was conducted. We now have a Senate President, his Deputy Senate President, Speaker and his deputy who we are very confident will do well.”&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpjZH14e49vZpqckaLCbrrEr5yrZaOWtqV5wKSnmpqZpHqiusNmmJuakah6uLHRnmSopl2ptaa10WamsKZdpbSnew%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./413965-the-top-10-essentials-effective-communication-skills-html.html><span>←</span><span>The top 10 essentials of effective communication skills</span></a>
