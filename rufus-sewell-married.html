So, who were Rufus's ex-wives, and how long did the marriages last?</p><p>Back in 1999, Rufus married an Australian fashion entrepreneur named Yasmin Abdallah. The marriage was a brief one, ending with the dawn of the new millennium in 2000. (According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Daily Mail</a>, the marriage ended due in part to Yasmin being a bit "messed up," according to Yasmin herself in retrospect!)</p><p>After Rufus and Yasmin split (she has since remarried), Rufus went on to marry again four years later. This time around it was to Hollywood producer, writer, and director <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Amy Gardner</a>, who was known for her producing work on projects like Everything I Ever Wanted to Tell My Daughter About Men, Virtually Single, and more.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-dTSxUT dyQypj"><p></p></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Does Rufus have any kids from his marriages?</h2><p>Although Rufus's marriage to Amy only lasted for two years (from 2004 to 2006), the couple did have one child together, a son named William Douglas Sewell, who is currently 21 years old.</p><p>William is Rufus's only son.

So how long have Ami and Rufus been dating, then?</p><p>According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Gossip Next Door</a>, Ami and Rufus have reportedly been an item since 2009. It's not completely clear if they're still together in 2023, given that Ami no longer has an Instagram page (the one that Rufus tagged Ami in on <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">his page</a> is no longer active), but there's no evidence to the contrary, either!</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Are all episodes of 'The Diplomat' available to stream on Netflix?</h2><p>Good news for Rufus fans — all eight episodes of The Diplomat are available to stream on Netflix.
