O Oyewumi, as well as the growing image of the National Industrial Court as a Court to reckon with, as a Court of justice and as a Court that would not readily cave in to the overbearing influence of the executive.</p><p>“At a wider level, it is suggestive of hope, freedom, justice and independence of thought in the judiciary for the judicial officers with requisite skill, knowledge and courage to take the right decisions.</p><p>“We may wish to recall the unlawful dislodgment of the Baruwa-led leadership, actively aided by the police.</p><p>“In spite of the openly partisan and dishonourable role played by the police in the matter, the Ministry of Labour did not summon the needed courage to ensure justice came the way of the Baruwa leadership.</p><p>“Eventually, this matter and the purported proscription of RTEAN became a sore point in our relations with the government, which in spite of its promise to have the issues resolved “in line with relevant ILO Conventions and the Nigerian Labour Act,” did nothing.</p><p>“It was this failure that led to the matter being taken to the National Industrial Court from whence came this laudable judgement,” the NLC President said.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpkZH10e5BqZqekk2K%2Fpq3CrapmmaNisLDB0a1kmp6Wnr%2Buv4ybmKutp5Z6or%2BMp6yrrKdivbOx0qKbnqakZA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./292724-moses-kuria-adai-wakulima-wa-mahindi-wana-tabia-mbaya-ya-kutaka-kumlaghai-uhuru-html.html><span>←</span><span>Moses Kuria adai wakulima wa mahindi wana tabia mbaya ya kutaka kumlaghai Uhuru</span></a>
