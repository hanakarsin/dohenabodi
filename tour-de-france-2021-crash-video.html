One of those cyclists is German rider Jasha Sütterlin, who “was taken to hospital for examinations which revealed no broken bones, but a severe contusion to his right wrist that will require further examinations back at home,” according to a statement from his team.</p><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-fyFmx rJYJh"><span>Source: NBC Sports/YouTube</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Tour de France spectators are urged to remain on the sidelines.</h2><p>Julian Alaphilippe, a French cyclist who suffered a knee injury in the crash before winning the stage, told&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Reuters</a>, “I hope everyone is OK.

Translated from French and German, "allez opi-omi" means “Come on grandpa-grandma." Presumably, the woman intended to share a fun message with her grandparents, who were watching the race from elsewhere. After the crash, though, we're guessing she probably hoped her grandparents weren't watching.</p><p>Belgian rider Jasper Stuyven&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">tweeted</a>, “I hope Omi & Opi are proud of you. On a serious note, though, great to see still many spectators are loving our sport and cheering for us, but please, stay on the side of the road, not on the road!”</p><p>Another crash on Saturday occurred with 7.5 kilometers (about 5 miles) remaining in the first stage.
