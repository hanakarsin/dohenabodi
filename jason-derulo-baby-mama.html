And since he welcomed his first child, social media users have become more intrigued with his life.</p><p>Many fans remember the days of <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Jason dating Jordin Sparks</a> and even considering the idea of marriage. Those days are long behind us as the singer is now a first-time father to a baby son, Jason King, whom he shares with model <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Jena Frumes</a>. The pair recently revealed their little one to the world on Halloween, and now fans believe that they may reconcile. So, are Jason Derulo and his baby mama getting back together?

The duo, who dated from March 2020 to September 2021, shocked fans with their breakup.</p><p>For starters, Jason and Jena split a mere four months after having baby Jason. Not to mention, the “Ridin' Solo” singer was first to share the news on social media — which many fans side-eyed online.</p><p>"Jena and I have decided to part ways," Jason wrote on Twitter. "She is an amazing mother but we feel being apart at this time will allow us to be the best versions of ourselves and the best parents we could be."</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>I don’t know their story but being in a relationship sucks.

Making matters worse, they both share the same birthday. Yikes!</p><p>“Blessed to share the same day of birth with my lover,” Jena wrote in a now-deleted post. "You are the most handsome, hardworking, talented, silly, loving human ever. You truly make me whole and I'm so grateful for the love we share."</p><p>She continued, "You and our mini make me the happiest girl in the world and I can't wait to make more memories with you guys. I know I'm a tough cookie but you make me soft and accept me for who I am and I'm forever grateful for that. Cheers to another year! I love you so much, forever.”</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Jason Derulo (@jasonderulo)</a></p></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Are Jason Derulo and Jena Frumes back together?
