They should not allow this opportunity to pass by.”</p><p>Describing the release of Kanu and about 400 people incarcerated in prison in facilities across the country as the best political solution, he said it would not only save Nigeria from further hurt and referendum, but also from disintegration.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpiZH5xe49wZpynpafBbr%2FTq6CknaNivLbAjKelmqWUnnqsrc2uqmarpZ7Bbq3GmqCnq6Ritaqzx2aaqK2iqXqktMienWaipZm0pns%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./wynton-harvey-html.html><span>←</span><span>Wynton Harvey - Age, Family, Bio</span></a>
