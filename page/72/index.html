Like, let's say a friend of yours has an extra ticket to a show because somebody they were supposed to go with dropped out and asks you if you want to go but doesn't mention anything about the price of the ticket until you're on your way to the venue, or right before you're set to go.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Raven's Home - Cast, Ages, Trivia</h2><time>Mar 24, 2024</time>
