Let's take a closer look at what she's revealed in her YouTube documentary <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Demi Lovato: Dancing with the Devil</a>.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Why did Demi Lovato call off her engagement?</h2><p>Shortly after Demi and Max ended their relationship, a source with knowledge of the situation <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">provided a statement to People magazine</a>.</p><p>"It was a tough decision, but Demi and Max have decided to go their separate ways to focus on their respective careers," the source explained. "They have respect and love for one another and will always cherish the time they spent together."</p><p>Of course, that wasn't the entire story.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Instagram</span></figure><p>Demi and Max started dating in March 2020, and they ended up quarantining with Demi's mother and step-father during the early months of the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic. After they went public with their romance, got engaged, and continued to progress at warp speed, some damning information about Max's past came to light.</p><p>Old tweets resurfaced of Ehrich professing his desire to "marry" Selena Gomez, Demi's former best friend.</p><p>"Max Ehrich is a creep that has tried to get famous women's attention for years (especially Selena Gomez)," <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">one Twitter user wrote</a>, alongside screenshots of the actor's online interactions with female celebrities.

It turns out, they were right about that, too.</p><p>"I realized as time went on that I didn't actually know the person that I was engaged to," Demi explained during the fourth and final installment of Dancing with the Devil. "Like all the people were like, 'Oh, they rushed into it,' or you know, 'Oh, it's not going to last,' and then like you proved them right. We were only together four to five months and like honestly, it was false advertising."</p><p>"The hardest part of the breakup was mourning the person I thought he was. But I'm not the only one that felt fooled," Demi continued. "I mean, I was just as shocked as the rest of the world at some of the things that were said and done."</p><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-dTSxUT dyQypj"><span>Source: Entertainment Tonight/YouTube</span></figure><p>In the months since Demi and Max broke up, the "Sorry Not Sorry" singer <a href=#>has come out as queer.</a></p><p>"There's so much left of me that I have yet to explore," she explained in Dancing with the Devil. "I actually feel like I'm too queer to marry a man in my life right now. There's a lot of things I have to do for myself first. I want to allow myself the ability to live my life in the most authentic form possible, which I just haven't done because of my past and some things I've needed to work on."</p><p>All four episodes of Demi Lovato: Dancing With the Devil are now available to stream on YouTube.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfrLWiwIyhmKmolaOypXnWoquhZZSauqp5wKebZqWRrQ%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./curtis-brooks-kids-behind-bars.html><span>‚Üê</span><span>What Did He Do and Where Is He Now?</span></a>
