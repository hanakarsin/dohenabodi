Lucky Irabor, has said that <a href=# rel=noopener><strong>putting an end to terrorist attacks in the Southern part of Kaduna State is beyond military</strong> </a>deployment.</p><p><strong>Naija News</strong> reports that terrorists have launched a series of deadly attacks on some areas in Kaduna State.</p><p>The bloodshed in Southern Kaduna has become a thing of concern for the nation as the terrorists are not slowing down in their invasions.</p><p>Over 100 persons have died in the attacks on different communities in the state.</p><p>As a result, many condemned the spate of insecurity across the country and called on the regime of President <strong>Muhammadu Buhari</strong> to take action to mitigate further attacks by the terrorist groups.</p><p>Reacting, however, to the sad developments, Irabor while addressing newsmen in Kafanchan, said Nigeria’s military has resolved to restore peace in Southern Kaduna.</p><p>Irabor, however, directed a threat to terrorists who are not willing to welcome peace in the state.</p><p>Irabor said: “We are committed to ensuring that peace is restored in this part of the country.</p><p>“However, for those who do not want to heed our appeal for peace and who think that violence is what they need to unleash on us, I am here to tell them that their days are numbered.”</p><p>He added: “If the peace in Southern Kaduna is disrupted, the peace in Kaduna and indeed the peace in Nigeria will be disrupted because Kaduna is central to the existence of Nigeria.</p><p>“You can have all the personnel and equipment in the world, if there is no willingness amongst the people to live in peace, it will count for nothing.”</p><p>Irabor stressed that there is a need to start looking at ways beyond military deployment to solve this crisis.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpiZH11e5BwZpuZnpm2tXnTnqmrp6KewLW%2FjJqemqGeYriquMtmq7CnXZ67brLRnqqhZaOkwrW0xKulZqORmcKvrYyaq62Zk6B8</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./pride-prejudice-html.html><span>←</span><span>Pride &amp;amp; Prejudice - Cast, Ages, Trivia</span></a>
