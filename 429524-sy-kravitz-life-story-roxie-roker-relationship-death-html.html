His parents are Joseph Kravitz and Jean Kaufman Kravitz, although not much information about them is public. However, they were Jewish-Russian immigrants, so Sy has mixed ethnicity.</p><p class=align-left>Seymour grew up alongside a younger brother, Leonard Harold Kravitz, with whom he shared an intimate relationship. Unfortunately, he died at 19 years old while fighting in the <a id=https://www.tuko.co.ke/402582-top-10-highest-paid-korean-actors-actresses-2021.html href=#>Korean</a> war while defending the country against a Chinese attack.</p><p class=align-left>Losing his brother affected Sy immensely, mainly because some <a href=#>family</a> members blamed him for Leonard's death. The reason for these claims was that Leonard had taken after his big brother in joining the military. In his death, the government awarded Sy's brother the Distinguished Service Cross.</p><h3>Education</h3><p class=align-left>Sy attended Beverly Hills High School. It is likely that he later pursued higher <a href=#>education</a>, but the details of the institution or the <a href=#>course</a> he studied remain a mystery.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/b786df4451649b89.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Alex Kompo: Former Siesta Key star's life and latest updates</span></p></a><h3>Career</h3><p class=align-left>You may be wondering, "What is Sy Kravitz famous for?" Sy Kravitz was an iconic American TV producer and US military officer. He was a veteran army officer who served in the Second <a href=#>World</a> War and the Korean War as a Green Beret.</p><p class=align-left>The media personality also served as a news reporter for NBC during the Vietnam War. In addition, Kravitz also served as the former President of the North East Chapter of the society of singers. He also made several media appearances, for example, the 2010 documentary <i>Sid Bernstein Presents.</i></p><h3>Sy Kravitz net worth</h3><p class=align-left>The ex-military officer made a fortune from his career in the army and media engagements. By the time of his death, Sy's net worth was approximately $1.5 million. The details of his property and <a id=https://www.tuko.co.ke/275464-new-untapped-business-ideas-kenya-2021.html href=#>investments</a> have remained undisclosed.</p><h3>Sy Kravitz marriage</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/720/d0c782f967cb08ca.jpeg><p class=align-left>In 1962, Kravitz married the love of his life, African American actress, news anchor, and TV personality Roxie Roker. Sy's wife was famed for her role in <i>The Jeffersons</i>, where she portrayed Helen Wills. The two have one son together, Lenny Kravitz.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/7bf4c477c2dbab8e.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Jack Sullivan Rudd: 5 things you may not know about Paul Rudd's son</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Unlike her on-screen marriage relationship, where she played the role of a happy wife, her actual marriage was nothing close to joyful. Lenny Kravitz' parents' union was marred with <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">infidelity issues</a>, and they went separate ways after more than 20 years. Their son revealed the details of their relationship through a memoir released in October 2020.</p><p class=align-left>When he was in his early 20s, Lenny overheard his father speaking to his mistress on the phone, an incident he later reported to his mother. The news broke her heart, but she also confessed to him that Sy had been unfaithful throughout their marriage. The woman in question was an employee at Sy's and Roxie's bank.</p><p class=align-left>Lenny's mother hired a private investigator who compiled evidence that led Sy to admit to cheating on his wife. The compilation included photographs and copies of plane tickets to Paris. However, because of her Bahamanian upbringing, Roxie was hesitant about filing for divorce because it was forbidden.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/f6adc970c00fe488.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>William Devane biography: The life and career of the Knots Landing and 24 star</span></p></a><p class=align-left>However, they eventually parted ways in 1985. It is not clear if Roxie got into another romantic relationship after their separation. Sadly, Roxie passed away in 1995 at 66 years old after battling breast cancer.</p><h3>Sy Kravitz' children</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/b786df4451649b89.jpeg><p class=align-left>Leonard Albert Kravitz, popularly known as Lenny Kravitz, is Sy's firstborn son born on May 26, 1964.

He was named after Sy's late brother Leonard. Lenny had a strained relationship with his father, who he described as loving and sensitive but also a hardcore disciplinarian, qualities that made him fear his dad.</p><p class=align-left>In addition, the former producer's son has also stated that his father was seemingly jealous of the success of Lenny and his mother's careers. These relationship constraints drew Kravitz closer to his mother, and he became a ''<a id=https://people.com/music/lenny-kravitz-honors-late-mother-new-memoir-let-love-rule-mamas-boy/ href=# rel="nofollow noopener">mama's boy</a>.''</p><p class=align-left>Before his parents officially parted ways, they had a <a id=https://edition.cnn.com/videos/bestoftv/2011/12/21/piers-morgan-lenny-kravitz-dad-cheating.cnn href=# rel="nofollow noopener">family chat</a>, and his mother asked her ex-husband if he had anything to say to Lenny. Surprisingly, Kravitz told Lenny that he would do the same things that he had done.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/7e05b3268adef167.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Dallas Yocum: Everything you need to know about Mike Lindell's wife</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Unfortunately, these words would later come to pass because he married fellow actress <a href=#>Lisa Bonet</a> in 1987, but they divorced in 1993 following claims of infidelity on Lenny's part. They have one daughter, Zoe Kravitz, who has taken after her father and is a budding <a href=#>musician</a> and actress.</p><p class=align-left>After Sy and Roxie split, he married a woman named Erica. Her background and other details of her life remain undisclosed.

During this season, he made peace with his son, and the two put their differences behind them. Lenny stated that the last month before his father died was the best month of their lives.</p><p class=align-left>Lenny Kravitz' father succumbed to leukaemia on October 29, 2005, at a hospital in New York City at 80 years old.
