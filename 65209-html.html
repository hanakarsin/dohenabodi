The president should take time to ask himself <i>“How Obama would have reacted to one missing girl from any school in the U.S.A., not to talk of <u><strong><a href=#>over 200 missing girls</a></strong></u>?”</i>.</p><p>The APC further declared that they were not calling for shutting governmental activities down. All the opposition party wants is cancellation of all the celebratory public outings and all the political campaigns, unless the crisis with missing schoolgirls is solved.</p><p class=MsoNormal>It would be added that Boko Haram sect has allegedly claimed responsibility for abduction of over 200 female students in Borno States, <u><strong>threatened to kill all of the hostages</strong></u> if the search and rescue operation would not be stopped.&nbsp;</p><p>Source: Legit.ng</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rbHGoqtnppdkg3Z%2Bj3JloaydoQ%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./what-happened-to-kristina-on-general-hospital.html><span>←</span><span>What Happened to Kristina on 'General Hospital'?
