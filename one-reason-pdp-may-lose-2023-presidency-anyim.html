Nobody is happy with where we are today as a nation and I have put my credentials on the table as someone who would help the nation to grow. I am seeking to protect our collective future, seeking to promote the growth of the nation,’’ <strong><a href=# rel=noopener>Anyim</a></strong> said.</p><p>The Plateau PDP Chairman, <strong>Mr Chris Hassan</strong>, said the people of the state are ready to support Anyim’s ambition, adding that the loyalty of the people of the state is always top-notch.</p><p>“We appeal to you to have at least one man on your campaign structure and if you do that you will not forget us. I know the friends you made in Plateau when you were senate president.</p><p>“Plateau people are not deceptive people, when they pledge to work with you, they do that with all their whole hearts,’’ he said.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpiZH10e5FxZqimlWK%2Fpq3SqKVmqJSleq6t2GajqKuVYn9xfpJmp6udo56xprrCsmSapqmeunA%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./289006-jamaa-amuanika-pasta-kwa-kumpokonya-mke-kanisani-html.html><span>←</span><span>Jamaa amuanika pasta kwa kumpokonya mke kanisani na kumpangishia chumba</span></a>
