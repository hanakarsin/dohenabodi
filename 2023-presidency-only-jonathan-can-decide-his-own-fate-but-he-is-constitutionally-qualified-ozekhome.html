Can he be caught in its web retrospectively?</p><p>“It is clear that those deliberately misinterpreting the clear position of the law may be baying for Jonathan’s blood, possibly as a potential candidate who may subvert the chances of their preferred candidates.</p><p>“I do not view issues from such a narrow ad homine prism and blurred binoculars. It will be grossly unfair, unconstitutional, unconscionable and inequitable to deny Jonathan of the right to contest the 2023 presidential election when our extant laws and appellate court decisions permit him to.</p><p>“The question of whether Jonathan really needs to subject his glittering and internationally acclaimed reputation and credentials to the muddy waters of a fresh competition with persons, some of whom were his personal appointees as president, is another matter altogether.</p><p>“Only him, and not the present state of the laws in Nigeria, can answer that question and decide his own fate. But, as regards his eligibility to contest, Dr Goodluck Ebele Azikiwe Jonathan is pre-eminently constitutionally, morally and legally qualified to contest the 2023 presidential election.”</p><p><strong>Naija News</strong> recalls&nbsp;Jonathan was Nigeria’s vice-president between 2007 and 2010. He became the President in May 2010 following the death of <strong>President Umaru Musa Yar’Adua</strong> and completed the latter’s tenure.</p><p>He contested and won the 2011 presidential election, but lost his second term bid in 2015 to <strong>President Muhammadu Buhari</strong> who contested as the candidate of the APC.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpiZH11e5JpZmtoYmh6sb7ErKCdnZ6Yxm67zaWwZqKfo661tMCnZJyZnmKxpq%2FInZxmoJmoerDDzWadmqyVYq%2B2wIyhnGaho2KwsLrSraCtraSevK%2Bty6WwZqmllrmqssiem2anqpq4qbvMnmY%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./it-is-impossible-for-bandits-to-leave-banditry-it-is-lucrative-inuwa-warns-tinubu-on-negotiation.html><span>←</span><span>'It Is Impossible For Bandits To Leave Banditry, It Is Lucrative'</span></a>
