It is not difficult, and you are capable of doing it, so most importantly – enjoy yourself!</p><ul><li>First of all, you should peel and boil the yam. This process can be completed with the help of mortar and pestle. The pounded yam serves as a thickener for the soup, and it can be eaten not only with Nsala but also with many other soups.</li><li>Then, grind your crayfish and uziza seeds. The uziza seeds need to be washed and sliced. In case you are using snails, you can wash them too.</li><li>As your next step, you will need to parboil your goat meat together with the needed ingredients. It is recommended to use two cubes of knorr, a bulb of onions, salt, and some kitchen glory for seasoning.</li><li>The meat has to be parboiled from twenty to forty minutes. Then, you will have to check if it is soft enough to consume. If it is, you can go further and add the dry fish washed in hot water. If you are using stronger dry fish, for instance, mangala, you will probably add it earlier. After you have put the fish, you should add some water – precisely from ninety to hundred centiliters. The water should be cold or boiled.</li><li>The amount of water you will pour into the Nsala soup is fully dependent on the availability of the ingredients and thickener, as well as the number of people who you are cooking the soup for. This is individual for everyone, so use your own wisdom.</li><li>The newly-made combination needs to be boiled for another short period of time – namely ten to twenty minutes. The ingredients need to be soft and well-prepared for consumption. Afterwards, you will have to add some ground crayfish, uziza seeds, and the ground pepper. Speaking of pepper, it is much better if you will use the red one because sometimes color makes difference.</li><li>You can now taste the soup. Depending on the taste, you can add some more kitchen glory, salt, or the cube of knorr. After that, taste once more and make sure it is good.</li><li>Now, you can add the pounded yam. If it does not seem thick enough, you can add some more of it. However, lighter soup usually tastes better than the thicker one.</li><li>Next step will be adding sliced uziza along with the utazi leaves. The latter are used only for the slightly bitter taste.</li><li>The Nsala soup with goat meat is ready! Now you can serve it to your closest people and amaze them with your cooking!</li></ul><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/d306f8c4c7bd5bd3.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=28><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>I hate cheap gifts - Actress Sylvia Oluchy says, gives reasons</span></p></a><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/85b44f187227b67f.jpg><p class=align-left>You have learned how to make delicious Nsala soup with goat meat.
