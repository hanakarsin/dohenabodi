Tribal bullying is uncivilized. So is any effort to strengthen insurgency in the country,” the presidential spokesman said.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWphZH16e5FxZqmqlai2pbHNnLBmq6Carqy%2FjKilZqSZqcGtsYydoJ%2Belaeyr6%2FEZpmerKeasq95yKmmm2WRo7Fuxc6rrJuZXaOutbXOp2San5mprrW70axm</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./netizens-knock-wole-soyinka-over-what-he-said-about-obidients.html><span>←</span><span>Netizens Knock Wole Soyinka Over What He Said About Obidients'</span></a>
