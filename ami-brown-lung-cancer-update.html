At the time, she was given survival rates as low as 3 percent.</p><p>“I had some pain in my back,” Ami told People that August. “Walking from the house to the garden, I would get winded. There were days I was just bedridden, but I just thought it was my arthritis."</p><p>We were filming the show and at times it was all I could do to just stand there — I was in so much pain. When we were shooting promo shots I told them, ‘There’s something wrong.’ In December [2016] I went to the dentist to get impressions made for new teeth and when they did a scan they noticed a little capsule. That’s how this all started.”</p><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-fyFmx rJYJh"><span>Source: Discovery/YouTube</span></figure><p>“Ami started getting sick months ago, and we didn’t know what it was, but it changed from the point of ‘Something’s wrong’ to ‘Something’s wrong,’” Billy Brown, Ami’s husband, said on Season 7 of Alaskan Bush People.</p><p>“She doesn’t want to be a burden on someone,” Billy explained. “That’s not Ami. Ami is to take the burden away and take care of everything, but she has to admit to herself that she can’t be that right now. It’s just time for us to pay it back to her right now, it’s all I think we can do.”</p><p>Youngest daughter Rain Brown, then 14, added: “I don’t care who you are. I don’t care what you’ve been through. I don’t care how old you are. If you hear that your mother has cancer, it’s going to shock you. I just wish I could change it somehow. I’m very scared for her.”</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="margin:8px 0 0;padding:0 4px"><a href=# style=color:#000;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none;word-wrap:break-word>Ami and Billy #alaskanbushpeople #alaskanbushppl #amibrown #billybrown #abpfans #brownfamily #abp</a></p><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap">A post shared by <a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px>Brown Family</a> (@brown_familly) on Nov 10, 2019 at 3:51am PST</p><span>Source: Instagram</span></figure><p>The family relocated from rural Alaska to Southern California so Ami could continue her medical treatment, and the rigorous radiation and chemotherapy treatments paid off.
