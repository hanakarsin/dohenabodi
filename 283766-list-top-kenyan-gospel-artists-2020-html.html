It is only recently that celebrated gospel musician Papa Dennis died putting a dark cloud on the industry. On the bright side, some great songs have already been released this year, and gospel charts are steaming hot. Several industry heavyweights are making a kill with their new hits, and there are also new names giving the established singers a run for their money.</p><h2>Top Kenyan gospel artists</h2><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/a630417da89784d2.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Top 15 black female gospel singers of all time</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Here are the top Kenyan gospel artists:</p><h3>1. Eko Dydda</h3><p class=align-left>Eko Dydda is an established Kenyan gospel musician whose star continues to shine. The talented gospel rapper can be remembered for entering into the gospel industry with a unique style that took the country by storm. His lyrics do not only inspire through their message, but the rhyme in his songs also makes them interesting to listen to. His latest songs include Tawala and Iwake.</p><h3>2. Danny Gift</h3><p class=align-left>Danny Gift is a relatively new artist who has been in the shadows of established gospel musicians in the country. The young singer is signed by EMB records. Danny Gift can be remembered from the hit Kazi ya Msalaba he featured Daddy Owen as one of his most successful songs.</p><p class=align-left>Although many might think that Danny is new to the music industry, he has been singing for over a decade, and his hard work has paid. His latest is called Unanijali, and it is worth listening to for some spiritual nourishing.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/f413669f1f15b2d9.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>15 best female dancehall artists of all time</span></p></a><h3>3. Janet Otieno</h3><p class=align-left>There will be many female gospel artists names on this list, with Janet Otieno being one of them. Janet has blessed her fans with her latest song Nijaze. Janet may not have always wanted to be a musician, but she discovered her talent in the church as a choir member. It was not until 2013 that she debuted as a professional gospel singer. One of the biggest hits she has produced is known as Napokea Kwako, which she collaborated with Christina Shusho.</p><h3>4. Mercy Masika</h3><p class=align-left>Mercy Masika is one of the most vocal Kenyan gospel musicians. She echoes stories of many other gospel singers who have made it from grass to grace. She has dominated the airwaves of gospel music and for a good reason. Her compositions are beautifully crafted, and her meticulous voice one of a kind.</p><p class=align-left>The worship leader at Jubilee Christian Church (JCC) has stood tall for a very long time, and in 2020 she continues to do so as evidenced by her latest song I’m Standing reminding us that she remains to be one of the best gospel artists in Kenya.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/f972722e01361ea1.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Who is the richest gospel singer in the world? Top 25 list</span></p></a><h3>5. Alice Kimanzi</h3><p class=align-left>There is always a touching or inspiring story behind most gospel artists, and Alice Kimanzi is no exception. The vocally talented musician has come a long way both in the music industry and as a family woman. She has narrated before that she began singing as a young child in nursery school with her three older sisters.</p><p class=align-left>Like most gospel artists, she was a choir member before deciding to go professional as a singer. She also participated in a talent search competition after high school, and that opportunity opened a whole world of music, including meeting her husband, who is also her producer. One of her latest songs is Yuko Mungu, which she has teamed up with Paul Clement.</p><h3>6. Size 8</h3><p class=align-left>Size 8 burst into the music scene with a lot of energy, and in those days, she used to sing secular music. The star produced club banger after club banger but had to ditch secular music and refocus her energy into gospel music. Many years have passed, and her star has refused to dim as she is now a top gospel artist.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/4ee23c26c849d365.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Who is the richest rock star in the world? List of 10 wealthiest rock musicians 2020</span></p></a><p class=align-left>On her latest project, she has teamed up with secular artist Wahu to release a song called Power Power. The two musicians affirmed that they had composed this song to appreciate the power of the Almighty God. The song has so far received divided sentiments, with some saying it sounds too secular while others fell in love with the new voice. Hopefully, Wahu is here to stay as a gospel artist because we all know she has the talent.</p><h3>7. Guardian Angel</h3><p class=align-left>Guardian Angel will never miss lists of gospel artists that have shaped the industry in Kenya. Guardian Angel may have wanted to quit music altogether a while ago and relocate to Canada, but he still soldiers on.</p><p class=align-left>By 2017 he was a household name in the music industry, but he felt that he hadn’t gotten the breakthrough he anticipated, and it was getting difficult paying bills. With renewed hope, he recently released Tawala a song that will be listened to for some time to come.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/8ed06bdff5006ccb.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Guardian Angel: 10 quick facts you probably didn't know</span></p></a><h3>8. Mr. Seed</h3><p class=align-left>Mr. Seed has been on the headlines recently for the wrong reasons. His departure from <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Bahati’s EMB records</a> was ugly as the two former friends were no longer seeing eye to eye. It prompted some exchange on social media as accusations flew from every corner.</p><p class=align-left>Mr. Seed has, however, moved on and has drawn inspiration from recent occurrences in his life, among them marriage. The newly married Mr. Seed welcomed his first child a while ago and then released a song titled Lovi Lovi for people to celebrate their loved ones. Nobody can deny that Mr. Seed tops among the best male gospel singers in this country.</p><h3>9. Eunice Njeri</h3><p class=align-left>Eunice Njeri is popularly known for walking out of her wedding a few years back. The singer was to wed rapper Izzo in the United States, but less than 24 hours into their marriage, she changed her mind. Unlike her failed marriage, her career as a gospel musician has been flourishing. She has a new song that is barely two months old titled Nani Kama Wewe.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/95a21a6feb0d2c23.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=29><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Miracle Baby real name, rise to fame, and top facts</span></p></a><h3>10. Collo G</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/a630417da89784d2.jpeg><p class=align-left>Collo G is a Kenyan Gospel rapper who is making a kill in the music industry in 2020. He shows us that the industry is still very welcoming to new artists. There are not so many mainstream gospel rappers in Kenya, and for that reason, we hope Collo G can push gospel music to another level on that front.</p><p class=align-left>His latest song is titled Unioshe, and he has collaborated with a group of artists called Wanavokali. With some perseverance, Collo G will topple the established popular male gospel singers as he continues to rise.</p><p class=align-left>Hardly two months have gone by, and 2020 has already witnessed a sea of Kenyan gospel songs. Gospel artists have upped their game, and we have seen some crossovers of big names from secular to gospel music. By the time the year comes to close, fans would have been treated to some of the best Kenyan gospel music of their lives.</p><p class=align-left><strong>READ ALSO: </strong>Best Kenyan gospel songs and artists 2020</p><p>Source: TUKO.co.ke</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tcHKqGWcp16gsnB%2Bl2xub25doba0wIytpqllm5q7uq3NZp6oq6CauW6t0a2grKyjYn9xfo9nn62lnA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./viktoria-html.html><span>←</span><span>Famous Viktorias | Famous Birthdays</span></a>
