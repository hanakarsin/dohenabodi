There will be tears (and lots of them,) plus drama between the contestants over who is "there for the right reasons," and finally, that those interested will be able to look up who the speculated winner is on <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Reality Steve</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>But, for <a href=#>Peter Weber</a>'s stint as the lead on Season 24 of The Bachelor, there has been no conclusive answer as to who the winner is, or if Peter even ends up with one of the women on the show.&nbsp;</p><p>One theory that is quickly gaining speed is that the winner of Peter's season is unknown is because he actually ended up with a producer.</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Who is Julie LaPlaca?</a> Breaking down the viral fan theory that Peter and her will walk away from the show as a couple, and where the theory came from in the first place. &nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Instagram</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Who is Julie LaPlaca?</h2><p>The reason why the theory about Julie and Peter is so compelling is because of how closely the two had to work together on The Bachelor. Julie is a producer at NKZ Productions, which produces the ABC reality series. She's been at the role since 2014, meaning that she's worked alongside her fair share of Bachelor leads.&nbsp;</p><p>Before working on the production end of The Bachelor, Julie worked as a producer for the medical talk show, The Doctors (starring Bachelor alum Dr.Travis Stork). She worked in production at several other companies, and she also interned at Seventeen Magazine and Extra.&nbsp;</p><p>Julie received her Bachelor of Applied Sciences degree in Advertising and Marketing Communications at F.I.T.&nbsp;</p><p>On her Instagram page, Julie has often shared pictures from behind the scenes of the show. She is close friends with Hannah Brown in particular, and she even referred to the former Bachelorette as "the Mary Kate to [her] Ashley" in the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">caption</a> of one photo.&nbsp;</p><p>Her tight-knit friendship with Hannah could potentially be complicated if the rumors between Peter and Julie are true, considering the fact that Peter is Hannah's ex.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="margin:8px 0 0;padding:0 4px"><a href=# style=color:#000;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none;word-wrap:break-word>1 more month til this bachelor takes off on the greatest flight of his life! üåπ‚úàÔ∏èüåπ#TheBachelor #bachelornation</a></p><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap">A post shared by <a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px>Julie LaPlaca</a> (@julielaplaca) on Dec 6, 2019 at 6:25pm PST</p><span>Source: Instagram</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Does Peter end up with Julie LaPlaca instead of one of the women on his season?</h2><p>The viral theory involving Julie and Peter originated from reddit user <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Krallie</a>. The "evidence" of their relationship is that Julie and Peter spent New Year's Eve together in New York, and she's been photographed with his family since filming wrapped.&nbsp;</p><p>In a photo that Julie posted from New Year's Eve, Peter can be seen in the background. Hannah Brown commented "This is really cute, Jules. I approve." Many theorized that Hannah was saying that she approved of her relationship with Peter.&nbsp;</p><p>Though this potential ending would explain why there's no concrete evidence that Peter chose either of his two finalists, Reality Steve sounded off on the rumors, saying that he didn't buy it.&nbsp;</p><p>"Gonna make this as simple as possible for every[one]since it‚Äôs all I get asked now: It‚Äôs garbage, there is absolutely nothing to this, it makes zero sense & people are desperately grasping at straws [because] the ending isn‚Äôt out yet,"<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> he tweeted</a> about the Peter/Julie rumor. "Hope that clears things up."</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Instagram</span></figure><p>If Peter and Julie did end up together as a couple at the end of The Bachelor, we likely wouldn't have seen as much interaction between the two online. Plus, per Julie's Instagram page, she's spent a lot of time off the show with other Bachelor/Bachelorette leads before, so her friendship with Peter isn't out of the ordinary.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Even Chris Harrison says they have an "intimate" relationship.</h2><p>Host Chris Harrison has been one to stir the pot on all of the rumors this season. In an interview on <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Access</a>, he admitted that Peter's relationship with Julie is very "intimate."</p><p>‚ÄúActually, I didn‚Äôt mean to do anything other than the fact that we spend a lot time together, we travel the world together,‚Äù Chris said. ‚ÄúJulie, an amazing, talented, smart producer that works for us ‚Äî works on the show, so she‚Äôs with Peter... It‚Äôs an intimate relationship. You spend that much time together we all get close. Sometimes those lines get blurred.‚Äù</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="margin:8px 0 0;padding:0 4px"><a href=# style=color:#000;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none;word-wrap:break-word>Knowin nothin in life but to be legit...

"Yes that was <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">@pilot_pete</a> in the tan jacket, no we didn‚Äôt kiss at midnight," she captioned a photo fo herself and Peter on Dec. 31. "But whoever ends up as his copilot for life is one lucky lady, because this guy has a heart of gold."</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="margin:8px 0 0;padding:0 4px"><a href=# style=color:#000;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none;word-wrap:break-word>Yes that was @pilot_pete in the tan jacket, no we didn‚Äôt kiss at midnight.
