On three occasions, I was able to send a message to Peter Obi that if he lost the election, it would be his followers who lost it for him.</p><p>“It was depressing to watch his lieutenant, a crucially positioned voice of a movement that has ‘broken the mould’, threaten the totality of social existence.”</p><p>However, some ‘Obidients’ were not happy about his comment and they have taken to the microblogging platform, Twitter to react.</p><p>Below are some of the reactions:</p><p>@Spotlight_Abby<br>“The wise ones say that an elder does not sit idly by while the goat dies in labour.<br>Not sure I saw Wole Soyinka condemn the ballot coup, voter intimidation & dangers of a president that’s involved in shady biz.<br>But Datti’s warning against a constitutional breach is the problem.”</p><p>@ViktorEdeh<br>“Has he bothered to at least caution oluomo and his touts ? He doesn’t see them as a problem? When it comes to Peter obi and obidients everyone has an opinion or begin to act as a moral compass.”</p><p>@AwunahNelly<br>“With all due respect Sir,I heard your full interview and I was at some point dissappointed when you said you too the back seat. If you and your cohorts never took the back seat,you wouldn’t see Obidients in this light. But because you left us tender to learn the hard way.”</p><p>@iam_samedoho<br>“And you didn’t warn Reno, FFK, Bayo et al. of their excesses. Give Nigerian youths good governance and leadership; let’s see if anyone will agitate for a better Nigeria. Please warn our leaders of their excesses- corruption, impunity, abuse of public office etc.”</p><p>@smeks123<br>“Lmao I will never forget this goat supported Buhari against Jonathan in 2015. Go and sit down somewhere, no one asked for your opinion.”</p><p>@maduka78<br>“Wetin this wan dey talk sef??? You leave wey fire dey burn dey wan quench candle wey dey give people light??? E be like say this ya grey hair na for fancy????”</p><p>@bukme_arb<br>“if he lost the election, it would be his followers who lost it for him”. They are doing thesame in the comments section. A scorpion only knows how to stings, even if you save him from danger it will still stings you cos that’s the only thing it knows how to do.”</p><p>@newsbeatportal<br>“Before the Election, and during the election, you were silent; how come you are suddenly firing on all cylinders two months after the Elections? Your bigotry stinks 😩”</p><p>@CMO_qEFC<br>“Tinubu has been supporting him financially for many years. He said it himself. So what do you expect from him? OBJ was right about him being a hypocrite.”</p><p>@peterstephen91<br>“I keep saying this.. This man is a tribalistic bigot.. He is a coward and an hypocrite who only criticise soft people that will not hurt him.. with all his English language, he can’t criticise INEC or Buhari.. He really pain me that I use to be his fan during GEJ’s time..”</p><p>@ogkuku2<br>“What are the excesses of Obidients, other than they passionately seek a new Nigeria heralded by non-corrupt politicians? The term fascism which opposes democracy cannot be used to address the Obidient movement. Soyinka’s utterances are unbecoming of a revered senior citizen.”</p><p>@chimaobiejike78<br>“prof good morning sir & thank you for coming out again after the subsidy protest you co lead during GEJ regime which lead to the birth of bubu government and after achieving your aim which is wrestle power from gej, you then went into 8yrs deep sleep. Once again good morning sir.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpjZH11e49uZqedpJ7HprrSZqKnp5Ogeri7y55krKepnrusrYyorZ6qXay1osCMoZxmq5GesW6twaisrWWfl7altcSnq6xn</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./lou-phillips-html.html><span>←</span><span>Lou Diamond Phillips - Age, Family, Bio</span></a>
