According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Celebrity Net Worth</a>, the former baller has a net worth of $500,000 as it stands today.</p><p>While he was in the NBA, he was reportedly earning a massive salary of $27 million per year. Based on modern-day inflation, he was earning what would be calculated as $43 million today.</p><p class="sc-eEVlDD iAFcKh"><span>Dennis Rodman</span></p><p class="sc-jlZIZy iWVnnf">Former NBA player and reality TV star</p><p><strong>Net worth:</strong> $500,000</p><p><strong>Dennis Rodman is a former NBA player and reality TV star.</strong></p><p><strong>Birthday: </strong>May 13, 1961</p><p><strong>Birthplace: </strong>Trenton, New Jersey, U.S.</p><p><strong>Education: </strong>North Central Texas (1983) Southeastern Oklahoma State (1983–1986)</p><p><strong>Spouse: </strong>Annie Bakes<strong> </strong>(m. 1992–1993), Carmen Electra (m. 1998–1999), Michelle Moyer (m. 2003–2012)</p><p><strong>Kids:</strong> 3</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><p>At one point, he was even labeled the 10th highest-paid player in professional basketball. However, according to the current reports of his net worth, Dennis's spending habits seemingly didn't leave him much room for savings or a retirement plan.</p><p>To make matters worse, someone he trusted actually robbed him of millions, as well. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Sports Rush</a> reports that his ex-financial advisor gave him fraudulent monetary advice leading Dennis down the path of financial ruin. The crooked advisor was Peggy Ann Fulford, and she ultimately pled guilty in court for her crimes.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Dennis Rodman's personal life is equally as interesting as his professional life.</h2><p>It's no secret that Dennis has always been considered one of the more interesting sports figures to keep up with. He has over 2.2 million followers on Instagram, where he shares interview clips, basketball highlights, and fun videos of his life.</p><p>Aside from what he shares on social media, the basketball star seems to be involved in worldly issues, as well. According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">NBC News</a>, Dennis spoke about traveling to Russia to try and release Britney Griner from prison back in August 2022.</p><p>In October 2022, Frankie Muniz, another star of VH1’s reboot of The Surreal Life, opened up to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Page Six</a> about what he noticed of Dennis while filming — and he admitted that he saw Dennis in the nude at least once. Now that the surreal life is back after 16 years, viewers have every right to gear up for some kooky and unforgettable moments.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by DENNIS RODMAN (@dennisrodman)</a></p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Instagram/@dennisrodman</a></figure><p>This season, Dennis is surrounded by several other celebrities with big personalities.
