Fans of NBC’s Night Court will be pleased to learn that a Season 2 is in the works.</p><p>On Feb. 2, 2023, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Variety</a> shared that NBC gave the sitcom an early Season 2 renewal.</p><p>“The verdict is in, and the ‘new-boot’ of ‘Night Court’ is a hit,” Channing Dungey, chairman and CEO of Warner Bros. Television Group told the outlet. “The series’ razor-sharp humor makes the show a weekly must-watch. We’re overjoyed that the court will remain in session and return with new cases for Season 2. We’re so grateful to our colleagues at NBC, to the richly talented creative team led by Melissa Rauch, Winston Rauch, Dan Rubin, and John Larroquette, and to the stellar ensemble cast.”</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Night Court picked up for Season 2!

Hopefully, all parties can agree so Night Court and other TV shows can resume production with workers receiving fair conditions and compensation.</p><p>Night Court airs on Tuesday night on NBC at 8 p.m. EST.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfo7aotNNmmqitoql6c3yRbGSsnZGovK95kQ%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./just-in-cbn-begins-sales-of-dollars-to-bdcs.html><span>←</span><span>CBN Begins Sales Of Dollars To BDCs</span></a>
