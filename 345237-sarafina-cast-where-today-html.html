Many recall the musical, which was adopted from the veteran theatre producer Mbongeni Ngema. The title’s reminiscent of one of the most phenomenal and emotional movies of the 20th century. The cast gave fans a great show, many playing the film on repeat. After all, what better was there to watch in the 90s when you have an astounding African movie? The film correctly depicts the events of a student uprising, borrowing from the June Soweto uprising in 1976. It is now more than twenty years after it was released, but it is still a great hit among those who relate to the apartheid era. Where is <i>Sarafina</i> cast today?</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/1120/fd7641927cc1e42e.jpeg><p class=align-left>When the film debuted, fans were dazzled by Whoopi Goldberg’s presence. She is an award-winning actress who has been part of numerous films and series. She had a significant role, which she played very well.

They were part of a fantastic movie with significant political and historical significance. That is why, at every celebration of the Soweto uprising, many recall the movie. Are there some of <i>Sarafina </i>original cast still making waves in the film industry?</p><h3>Leleti Khumalo - Sarafina</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/c85f1d12d0749e8a.jpeg><p class=align-left>Do you remember the sweet, yet fierce pretty girl playing the lead role in <i>Sarafina</i>? Leleti Khumalo acted as young Sarafina in the musical. Since this role was one of her biggest in her career, the name Sarafina stuck.</p><p class=align-left><i>Sarafina</i> introduced her to the masses, and it will always be a part of her. She was only 16 years old while she was acting as Sarafina in 1992.

She was a household servant in a white household in apartheid South Africa. Angelina's acceptance of this role had a massive impact on Sarafina's inspiration to rise up in protest.</p><p class=align-left>Even though Miriam Makeba died on November 10, 2008, many remember her as the most prominent African singers in the 20th century. Her amazing talent earned her the name "Mama Afrika."</p><h3>Somizi Mhlongo - Fire</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/720/3920d4a1961bd8b2.jpeg><p class=align-left>How many people do you know that were popular more than thirty years ago and are still relevant? Somizi, aka Somgaga, is a darling of the masses and certainly has the star power. In the <i>Sarafina</i> musical, he played a student leader that was pivotal in the student uprising. Many remember the name "Fire," which was Somizi’s character’s name in the movie.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/ff6048084814cac1.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Wanja Wohoro: 10 quick facts you need to know about the musician</span></p></a><p class=align-left>The Somizi in <i>Sarafina</i> was on fire (pun intended), and it was no surprise that he became a very successful entertainer in South Africa. Almost three decades after the movie, Simizi is 46 years old and still sways the crowd wherever he goes. He has created an enormous brand that's making significant headway in the entertainment industry.</p><p class=align-left>Mhlongo has a best-selling book, <i>Dominoes: Unbreakable Spirit</i>, is a renowned reality TV star, judge for Idols South Africa, media personality, choreographer, and a popular MC.</p><p class=align-left>Also, Somizi is a very <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">active supporter </a>of LGBTQ rights in South Africa and is quite open about his intolerance of discrimination towards LGBTQs. The best thing about Mhlongo, which is what has probably managed to keep him afloat all these years is his originality.</p><p class=align-left>What you see is what you get, and he has never mimicked an accent or changed any aspect of his personality. Many love his realness that has been a great pillar for this reputation.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/f9c220dbd6c5507d.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Selina cast: The faces of your favourite actors and actresses</span></p></a><h3>John Kani - School principal</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/0d288d752a6b6f16.jpeg><p class=align-left>Who could ever forget the school principal!

The songs were melodious and well-choreographed, and to think this was a creation that is more than twenty years old is impressive. Remember the much-loved Lord’s Prayer, led by a beautiful songstress hitting the highest notes.</p><p class=align-left>Khanyo played the role of a young school girl that led the crowd and perfectly depicted excellent synchronization. Many recall the choreography that ensued once the songstress started the Lord's Prayer on a high note.</p><p class=align-left>Where is she today? She is a recording artist with numerous works. Khanyo even featured on the soundtracks for The Lion King. Her sound depicted the <i>Sarafina</i> movie theme quite well.
