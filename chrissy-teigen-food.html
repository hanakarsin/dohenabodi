These foods had their beloved fanbases, who felt attacked. First up was Nutella.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: twitter</a></figure><p>Now, there are a bunch of people who didn't appreciate that Chrissy came after their favorite food like that. We all know that Nutella devotees exist all around the globe and they're going to defend their love for the spread tenaciously.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: twitter</a></figure><p>She provided some hilarious and enlightening reasons why people who are obsessed with Nutella are wrong for continuing their obsession, and managed to even provide some other "alternatives" to the food that would make for a better consumption experience.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: twitter</a></figure><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: twitter</a></figure><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: twitter</a></figure><p>She wouldn't let up on on the examples (that Bush's baked beans one was cold), but when she finally did, she pivoted and explained why people seem to like the chocolate hazelnut spread so much: because it's spreadable chocolate.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: twitter</span></figure><p>Let's be honest though, she's not wrong that Nutella is garbage because if you wanted a chocolate spread, then get some high quality chocolate that actually tastes good and not the hazelnut/frosting/sugary nonsense that we're currently being hoodwinked into purchasing.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: twitter</a></figure><p>In fact, Nutella has more calories and sugar than chocolate frosting, meaning that it's actually worse for you to eat this stuff than simply scooping cake frosting out of a jar. "Oh but Nutella's made with hazelnuts!" you might argue.</p><p>And another part of your argument might try and make the case that Nutella's somehow healthier and packs more nutritional value than cake frosting as a result, because, again, it's made with hazelnuts. Well, you'd be wrong about that, kiddo, because <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">they upped the already high sugar content</a> and are putting even less of those hazelnuts in their spread.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: getty</span></figure><p>Sure, there might be <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">commercials featuring insane parents serving their kids Nutella for breakfast</a>, like it's supposed to be healthy for them or something, but that's completely misleading nonsense. There's nothing healthy or balanced about that meal.</p><p>It's a stance that Chrissy Teigen stuck to when she was featured on a recent episode of Hot Ones to promote her cookbook. Her opinion hasn't changed in four years, people, and I totally applaud her for staring the pro-Nutella lobby in the face and sticking to her guns.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: first we feast</a></figure><p>She went as far as calling the stuff "The Mimosa of Foods" and frankly, I have to agree. A mimosa's a sugary, alcoholic beverage that has somehow become an acceptable beverage to have with your brunch meal. But why is sugar-packed booze OK to drink at 11am? I mean, I know it's Sunday, but come on.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: first we feast</a></figure><p>While we're on the subject of chocolate, let's talk about Chrissy's dislike of Milky Way bars, which she easily defended when people came at her saying that they're delicious. The only question she needed to ask these Milky Way Lovers was the last time they ate one.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: twitter</span></figure><p>I'd say that Milky Ways serve a purpose: to satisfy a cheap chocolate/caramel fix for those who can't eat Snickers due to nut allergies. I'd just say get a Caramello instead — they're much better in every single way.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: mars</span></figure><p>Just like her position on Nutella, Chrissy hasn't budged from the anti-Milky Way stance she took a year ago. I mean, the only reason to like a Milky Way is because it was part of a great extended joke in This Is the End.</p><p>Another casualty was deep dish pizza. Now I'm probably going to offend a lot of Chicagoans right now, but, I'm sorry, there's no way that deep dish pizza can be called pizza. I've never had a good slice of it before in my life. Ever.</p><p>In her food blog, Chrissy Teigen gave a very thorough review of the three "top" deep dish pizza joints that people recommended she try out. So she ordered a single pizza each from these places and put her thoughts on her blog.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: sodelushous</a></figure><p>I have to say that I agree with the results. I mean look, if you like soggy bread slathered in sauce with an unholy amount of toppings on it that make you feel like a yeast factory is going on in your gut, then congratulations: the sopping, sloppy mess that is deep-dish pizza is definitely for you.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: twitter</a></figure><p>And yes, people are going to be upset that Chrissy had some very choice words for the food because, despite the obvious fact it isn't pizza, some people are insisting that it is and that it's a food that should be respected. Bizarre, I know.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: twitter</a></figure><p>But there were more than a few people who agreed with her findings. These people are in the right. Look I'm not saying you can't enjoy the meal that is referred to as "deep dish" pizza. You can, that's your right and it's your prerogative.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: twitter</a></figure><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: twitter</a></figure><p>And that's what makes this world great: we all can choose to be wrong about certain things. I mean there are some people out there who actually like the taste of Swedish Fish Oreos and think that Friends is funnier than The Nanny. Insane, I know.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaJ6fpLFwfo9qb2hpYGR9dnu5rY2sfoRksKm%2ByKyqsmWkmraosc1mnainlA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./the-wheel-of-time-season-2.html><span>←</span><span>When Is 'The Wheel of Time' Returning For a Second Season?
