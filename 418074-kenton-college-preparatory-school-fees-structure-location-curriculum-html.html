The school’s original owner, Finlay Cramb, started the learning institution in an empty German sanitorium and fast transformed it into one of the best learning institutions in Kenya. However, it wasn't until 1934 that the school's original structures, which stand until today, were built.</p><p class=align-left>Kenton school was built on open land in Kileleshwa, five kilometres from Nairobi City centre. Later, the learning institution moved to reopen at its current location in January 1935.</p><p class=align-left>One of the most interesting things about Kenton is that it was a <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">military headquarters</a> during <a href=#>World</a> War II. During this time, learners were forced to relocate to Westpark Hotel at Ngong. However, everything resumed once the war ended, including its reinstatement as the primary learning centre for all students.</p><p class=align-left>The school underwent a massive transformation over the years, including getting a new headmaster, <a href=#>Rev</a> Cyril Banks. He retired in 1966, leaving solid links between the school and well-known schools in Britain. Rev. Roy Stagg took the headmaster role in 1966 and ran it for the next 14 years.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/9afc821a5c04d6e2.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=30><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Pangani Girls: fees structure, KCSE performance, uniform, location</span></p></a><p class=align-left>The <a href=#>learning institution </a>had further headmaster replacements in 1980 and 1991. During this period, Kenton School increased its capacity to 200 boys. Mr. Searle, who took over in 1991, made radical alterations, including making the school mixed. And this created an opportunity for expansion.</p><p class=align-left>Today, Kenton College Preparatory School is one of the ten IAPS Preparatory Schools in Kenya and among the top 500 in the world.</p><h2>Kenton College curriculum</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/443fadf61abb1b31.jpeg><p class=align-left>What curriculum does Kenton School Nairobi abide by?
