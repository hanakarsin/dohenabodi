Police in Washington, D.C., are said to be investigating Blake's death as a suicide.</p><p>According to an internal memo circulated by Joseph Kahn, the publication's executive editor, Blake "quickly distinguished himself as our lead politics newsletter writer and a gifted observer of our country’s political scene."</p><p>Through this, the late journalist "became an indispensable and always insightful voice in the report during a busy election cycle."</p><p>Born on Sept. 4, 1978, in California, Bernard Blakeman Hounshell spent most of his early life between Delaware and Pittsburgh, Penn. In 2002, Blake graduated from Yale University with a degree in political science. His journalism career began when he studied Arabic while living in Cairo. This eventually led to him becoming a finalist for the Livingston Awards for Young Journalists in 2011 thanks to his coverage of the Arab Spring uprisings.</p><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-fyFmx rJYJh"></figure><p>Blake leveraged this success to become the managing editor of Foreign Policy from 2009 to 2013, garnering the publication three National Magazine Awards. He then worked as the editor-in-chief at Politico for eight years before joining the team at The New York Times, where he worked up until his death.</p><p>Our thoughts are with Blake's family, friends, and fans during this difficult time.</p><p><strong>If you or someone you know are experiencing suicidal thoughts, call, text, or message the </strong><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>988 Suicide and Crisis Lifeline</strong></a><strong>.
