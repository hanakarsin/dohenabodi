This has been a recurring theme throughout the career of WNBA legend <a href=#>Sue Bird</a>.</p><p>Sue Bird has fielded numerous inquiries about a potential familial link to NBA legend and Hall of Fame icon <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Larry Bird</a>. So, is there any truth to these speculations?</p><p>In an exclusive interview with Distractify, Sue Bird — in partnership with Barbie — sets the record straight once and for all. Read on to hear what she said!</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Steph Chambers/Getty Images</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">So, is Sue Bird related to Larry Bird?</h2><p>We hate to break it to you! Folks who believe that Sue and Larry are relatives will be surprised to learn that they are not related.</p><p>"Since I've been 5, people have asked me if we're related," Sue told the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">WNBA</a> back in 2006. "It is usually the third question in a line of questions. What's your name? Sue Bird. Oh, what do you do? I play basketball. Are you related to Larry Bird? That's how it goes."</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Kevin C. Cox/Getty Images</span></figure><p>In our exclusive interview with Sue, she revealed that she finds it "hilarious" how many people mistakenly think she's related to Larry Bird. She also revealed how she's handled countless inquiries about their non-existent family connection.</p><p>"Up until, who knows, second or third grade, I was lying and telling people he was my uncle!" she told us.</p><p>A few years ago, Sue finally met Larry Bird in person. She recounted the interaction to Distractify, saying, "I actually got to meet him a couple of years ago for the first time. And that was like my big joke. I was like, 'Larry, I know you don't know this, but you've actually been in my family for years. Hi, I'm your niece!' So ya know, it's fun. I have fun with it."</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Sue Bird retired from the WNBA as one of the greatest players in the league.</h2><p>Although Sue and Larry are not related, fans believe that Sue's legacy is quite similar to Larry's. Throughout her professional career, Sue was named a 13-time WNBA All-Star, was selected five times to the All-WNBA First Team, and was a three-time WNBA assist leader.</p><p>However, most basketball fans admire Sue for winning not one, not two, but four WNBA Championships with the Seattle Storm in 2004, 2010, 2018, and 2020. Plus, Sue won five Olympic gold medals in 2004, 2008, 2012, 2016, and 2020. She went on to retire in 2022.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><p>On the flip side, Larry won three championships during his tenure with the Boston Celtics in 1981, 1984, and 1986. He also earned three MVP titles, two Finals MVP titles, was a 12-time NBA All-Star, and made the All-NBA First Team on nine occasions. Larry Also has an Olympic Gold medal under his belt!</p><p>The parallels between Sue and Larry's professional basketball careers are mind-blowing, but greatness is something that can be achieved with hard work and dedication.</p><p>With additional reporting by Allison DeGrushe.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfnsBuv9SeZJuhopl6s7HLmquenF2pvG64wKupsmWSnr%2Blew%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./2024-olympic-qualifier-nigerias-dtigress-defeats-senegal.html><span>←</span><span>2024 Olympic Qualifier: Nigerias DTigress Defeats Senegal</span></a>
