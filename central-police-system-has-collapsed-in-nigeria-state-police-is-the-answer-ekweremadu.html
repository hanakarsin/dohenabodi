The problem with our security setup is that we forget we are running a federal system of government. There is nowhere in the world where a federal government runs a unitary police.</p><p>“What is happening right now is that the central police system that we run has collapsed. That’s why we bring in soldiers to do the work of the police.”</p><p>Speaking on the practicability of the state police system in Nigeria, Ekweremadu said the federal police will continue to exist as it currently obtains, and only an additional 36 police units for each state of the federation will have to come on board.</p><p>With the development, the lawmaker said Nigeria will have enough security agents to tackle issues and avoid any overwhelming situation.</p><p>He said a collaborative effort will be employed between the federal and state police operatives while neigbouring states can also get help from one another.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWphZH5xe5BwZpydnqm%2ForiMqaaloZOaerTF0q2cpmWYlsBur86lo5qoo5qxbrXNZqWin5WntqJ50q2YrZ1dpbyttcKeZKKrXam1pnnAp6qwnaJisqzDxKucppmUqnw%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./you-have-no-business-leading-people-baba-ahmed-roasts-adebanjo-edwin-clark.html><span>←</span><span>You Have No Business Leading People</span></a>
