I can see that a lot of analysts are out with long knives; some coming to join us in cutting the cake, others totally determined to make mincemeat of our achievements.</p><p>“This is to be expected given the phenomenal role and place of President Muhammadu Buhari as a mass leader who has achieved the trust of the common men and women in our vast country.”</p><p>The man who has vowed to secure the country from terrorism, rid the country of corruption and diversify its economy has achieved so much of that agenda, making it possible for him to win and keep the trust of the people.</p><p>While we are not yet where we would like to be, we are also definitely not where we used to be; we have seen significant progress in many sectors across the three priorities of the president: security, economy and the fight against corruption. Keep in mind that true progress takes time.</p><p>We must be realistic, the challenging circumstances that took us decades to get into, and that previous administrations with access to more resources failed to make a dent on, will not be rolled back overnight.</p><p>Any assessment of the president has to take into account the situation he inherited when he took office. Lasting change will take time. The most important thing is to show that we are headed in the right direction, and we definitely are.”</p><p>Shehu further listed the major achievements of the Buhari administration to include agricultural developments, enhanced national security, greater infrastructural growth, corruption fight, etc.</p><p>He also declared that President Buhari is not a man that will go back on his promise of change to Nigerians, noting however that all campaign promises can’t be fulfilled in 5 years.</p><p>The presidential media aide made the submission in response to a question posed on when the administration intends to fulfill its campaign promises to Nigerians.</p><p>He noted that progress is been made and promises would be fulfilled before the president’s tenure expires in 2023.</p><p>“It is important to focus on the things that have actually been done and the progress recorded instead of playing “what-if” games. Many of the things you have listed above, like removing immunity, passing bills and so on fall within the purview of the legislature, not the executive. So you should know which questions should be asked which arm or tier of government.”</p><p>“Other things like economic diversification and reduction of cost of governance are work in progress – but nobody promised that they would be fully achieved in five years,” he noted.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpgZH12e5FyZputmJa%2FqnnNnq2eql2lv7C5yKycnWWkpHqnwcufoKWkXZa5rXnCmqSpmZmcu2680aikoquVqHqquoxuZLKdkafAbrPAq5maZaOdsqnBjg%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./barbie-pvm-html.html><span>←</span><span>Barbie. pvm - Edad, Familia, Biografa</span></a>
