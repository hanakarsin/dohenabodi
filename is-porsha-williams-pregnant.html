Now, rumors have surfaced that Porsha and her new beau are expecting. But <a href=#>is she really pregnant</a>?</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Fans believed Porsha Williams was pregnant because of her Instagram posts and rush to marriage.</h2><p>Fans initially thought that the oversized dress the RHOA star wore when she was pictured alongside Simon and her ex Dennis McKinley on Mother’s Day may have been hiding a baby bump.&nbsp;</p><p>One user <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">tweeted</a>, “Porsha pregnant ... she had to jump in front of that tea that’s brewing ... that’s all this public announcement is for chile."</p><p>Some rumors even speculated that Falynn and Porsha may be pregnant at the same time. Another fan <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">shared</a>, “If it turns out Falynn and Porsha are both pregnant with Simon’s child then me and my iPhone will be flying out to Atlanta so I can film the next season myself.”</p><p>While many fans focused on Porsha’s possible pregnancy, other Real Housewives of Atlanta viewers took to social media and suggested that Kenya Moore’s speculations about her co-star had been right all along.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>See, this is what Kenya has been talking about with the whole Bolo thing.

If she had dumped Marc and went after [Falynn]’s husband and got pregnant by him, you would be calling for her to be stoned in the street. Y’all have different rules for her,” one RHOA viewer wrote on <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Twitter</a>.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Porsha Williams is setting the record straight: She's not pregnant.</h2><p>After setting social media ablaze with the shocking news of her engagement, fans were convinced that she had to be expecting a child. However, that doesn't seem to be the case with the Real Housewives of Atlanta star.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><p>While hosting Dish Nation, the reality star decided to keep it real with her fans about the pregnancy rumors.</p><p>“I am not pregnant,” she said on May 18, 2021. “This is not a shotgun wedding.”</p><p>Fans have long believed that Porsha is a "hopeless romantic" and typically rushes into relationships. Since she is getting married so fast, fans thought that a bundle of joy may have been a factor in the engagement. But that evidently isn't the case.</p><p>Porsha has also relied on social media to help her clear up the pregnancy rumors.&nbsp;</p><p>In a recent Instagram post, the reality star decided to show off her curvaceous physique.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by #PorshaWilliams (@porsha4real)</a></p><span>Source: Instagram</span></figure><p>Donning a skin-tight red bodysuit while preparing for a workout, Porsha posted the picture just before speaking on her upcoming marriage.</p><p>"Back at it, loading..." she captioned the photo with a fire emoji.&nbsp;</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Porsha Williams previously suffered a miscarriage.</h2><p>Nearly six years before welcoming her now 2-year-old daughter, Pilar, with her ex Dennis McKinley, Porsha suffered a miscarriage. In Porsha’s pregnancy announcement, she opened up about her experience and shared how excited she was to finally become a mother.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Instagram</span></figure><p>Porsha previously told <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">People</a>, “When I found out I was pregnant, I was excited [but] I had mixed feelings. The other feeling that I had beside excitement was fear. I’ve had a miscarriage before in my past, which I’ve also been open about because I suffer with fibroids and had to have a myomectomy.”&nbsp;</p><p>She added, “So just the fear of, ‘Is the baby going to be okay? Will I make it full term?’ All those questions that you ask if you’ve had a miscarriage before.”</p><p>Although Porsha and Simon are not expecting, that doesn't rule out the pair getting pregnant in the future. Until then, we'll just have to wait and see how things pan out.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfnsBuvM6rqqGZXay2rbjImqSsZaCnsqi6wKer</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./381182-buhari-is-a-better-choice-to-jonathan-soyinka-html.html><span>←</span><span>Buhari Is A better Choice To Jonathan- Soyinka</span></a>
