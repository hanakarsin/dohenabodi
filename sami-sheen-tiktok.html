[Sami] didn’t want to follow the rules.” The source added, “Charlie didn’t support implementing Denise’s rules. He has a different way of parenting and Sami decided to live with her dad.”</p><p>According to reports, Sami eventually reconnected with her mom and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">moved back in with her</a> in 2022.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a title=@samisheen href=#>@samisheen</a><p>hehehe <a title=grwm href=#>#grwm</a> <a title=work href=#>#work</a> <a title=makeup href=#>#makeup</a> <a title=sworker href=#>#sworker</a></p><a title="♬ original sound - ✩ sami ✩" href=#>♬ original sound - ✩ sami ✩</a></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Sami Sheen continued to make headlines because of her OnlyFans.</h2><p>Sami <a href=#>joined OnlyFans</a> in June 2022, three months after she turned 18.</p><p>At first, her dad didn't condone it, but he later said he had a change of heart when he talked to Denise about it. He then announced that he and Denise were a "<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">united front</a>" in supporting Sami in her endeavors. Meanwhile, Denise said in July 2022 that after she looked into what OnlyFans was all about, she found it "<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">empowering</a>" and <a href=#>decided to join too</a>.</p><p>In June 2023, Sami caused a stir when she posted a GRWM ("Get Ready With Me") video on TikTok where she referred to herself as a "sex worker." After this blew up online, she posted another TikTok soon after to address some things.</p><p>"OK, I need to clear some things up," she said. "I'm not a [porn] star and I don't meet up with people, i don't film myself having sex. I don't do that but I also have no judgment toward the people who do do that; that's just not my line of work and that's not something I'm comfortable doing."</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a title=@samisheen href=#>@samisheen</a><p>Replying to @🇯🇲 clearing some things up!!</p><a title="♬ original sound - ✩ sami ✩" href=#>♬ original sound - ✩ sami ✩</a></figure><p>"The only reason I said I'm a [sex] worker is because my main source of income is from my [OnlyFans]," she continued. "And if people did their f------ research, they would realize that there are multiple forms of [sex] work."</p><p>Sami explained that she loved her job, and that there's "absolutely nothing that anyone could say to make me want to get a different job at the moment." She said the job makes her happy, boosted her confidence, and allowed her to work from home and set her own hours.</p><p>"I could go on for hours explaining myself but I don't need to do that, I shouldn't have to do that," she noted.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Denise previously opened up about Charlie, Sami, and more on 'Real Housewives of Beverly Hills.'</h2><p>Denise previously opened up on an episode of The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills in Season 10 about raising teenage girls.
