Sadly, <a href=#>TikTok</a> user <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">@kadiaimantv</a>’s big day was marred by controversy.

Things went left when it was Kadia’s turn to take the mic and state her name and major. Unfortunately, her introduction was cut short by an administrator, who Kadia said snatched the mic away from her, first.</p><p>“You didn’t let me get my moment,” Kadia explained before she dramatically dropped the mic. “I don’t like how you snatched the mic out of my hand, so today is going to be all about me.”</p><p>Later, Kadia took to TikTok to detail what happened before the camera started rolling. According to her, she was just as surprised as we were by the series of events that sparked the altercation.</p><p>The TikToker explained that she and a classmate had noticed early on in the ceremony that Black graduates were being treated differently than their white counterparts.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a title=@kadiaimantv href=#>@kadiaimantv</a><p>@tiktok you are racist stop removing mt video i am a black woman speaking from being silences … why take my video down ( full story on my page )</p><a title="♬ original sound - kadiaimantv" href=#>♬ original sound - kadiaimantv</a></figure><p>“I didn’t even get to finish getting to say my name,” the graduate <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">said</a> of the now-viral video. “The people that went before me and everything — they all got to say their name, their major, and even extras."</p><p>“I don’t want to be that person, but that was the tea,” she went on. "I just couldn’t let that happen. Because I just feel like I worked so hard to graduate and went through so much s--- to graduate that I just felt like I had to reclaim my moment, I’m sorry.”</p><p>“That was the only time I was able to speak. So I just feel like that wasn’t right.”</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a title=@kadiaimantv href=#>@kadiaimantv</a><p>Replying to @mochabankz2.0</p><a title="♬ original sound - kadiaimantv" href=#>♬ original sound - kadiaimantv</a></figure><p>What you may not know is, the video has a deeper meaning than what meets the eye. In a TikTok <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">video</a> that was posted before everything went down, Kadia expressed how happy she was to get a degree despite no one showing up to support her. Per her social media, Kadia’s mom died earlier in her life.</p><p>So, let’s put ourselves in Kadia’s shoes for a second. It’s hard enough for a young, Black woman to find her voice at a predominately white institution (<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">PWI</a>) — especially with no support system.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: TikTok/@kadiaimantv</a></figure><p>Now, after you’ve dedicated the last several years to this moment, you’re robbed by a white woman in a stole. While some argue that Kadia could have handled the situation more gracefully, I, on the other hand, do not.</p><p>Who knows what trials and tribulations Kadia had to go through to walk across the stage — or, in her case, the lawn — and there is no amount of respectability politics that can take that away from her.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Twitter/@punkiepapa2020</a></figure><p>After all, none of this would have happened if Professor Karen hadn’t snatched the mic away in the first place. But now, I bet she knows to put some respect on our good sister’s name — and that’s on period, pooh.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfrLyurc1mnquZkqh6rrXCZpitZZenrqXBwK2gqKY%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./did-eminems-daughter-die.html><span>←</span><span>Did Eminem's Daughter Die?
