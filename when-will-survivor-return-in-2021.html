The highly-acclaimed competition show has developed a cult-like following over the years, yet the hurdles of the coronavirus pandemic made it impossible for CBS to keep filming uninterrupted.</p><p>Thankfully, it seems as though host <a href=#>Jeff Probst</a> and his crew have finally figured out a way for the ambitious production to come to fruition despite the adverse circumstances. So, when will Survivor return in 2021? Here's what we know so far.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by JEFF PROBST (@jeffprobst)</a></p></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">When will 'Survivor' return in 2021? The show just went back into production.</h2><p>Although news of production on Survivor ramping up again is reassuring, fans may still have a little bit of a wait before new episodes air. The original air date of March 2020 was understandably pushed back several times as the coronavirus pandemic developed, but the finish line is seemingly finally near. With the show now tentatively set to air in September 2021, the wait for new episodes is almost over.</p><p>Jeff detailed his excitement for the next season of Survivor in an <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Instagram</a> video. There, he explained, "Fiji has invited us back to their beautiful country to shoot season 41. We have all of our COVID protocols in place so that everybody in Fiji will remain safe, all of our crew will be safe and of course, our players will be safe."</p><p>He continued to double down on his excitement for the new season by comparing it to the difficult year 2020 was for many. "I can’t remember a time when I’ve been this pumped to shoot Survivor. The past year has reminded me and I hope it’s reminded you that you got to live your life like it’s one big great adventure and Survivor fulfills that so I am thrilled to say I will see you on the island for Survivor 41. Let’s do it," the host added enthusiastically.</p><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-fyFmx rJYJh"></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">What is the 'Survivor 41' theme? The seasons have each had their own unique take.</h2><p>Every season of Survivor seems to have a more unique theme than the last, and 41 will surely not disappoint. Despite no solid confirmation on what it will be (yet!), that information is surely to come out sooner rather than later. Given that the last season, "Winners at War," which saw old season champions vying against each other for a second title, was a fan favorite, producers will surely deliver after an extra year of time to think themes over compared to the past.</p><p>With rumors that CBS is filming seasons 41, 42, and casting for season 43 of Survivor all within 2021, it's apparent that the network is working harder than ever. As COVID-19 regulations become laxer internationally over time, the show is speeding to deliver as much content as possible for its die-hard viewers.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfrLWmuoywoKWkXajCs8LIr6arZaKawba%2BzWagp2ViZX9y</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./kolanii-html.html><span>←</span><span>Kolanii - Trivia, Family, Bio</span></a>
