T. Hellstrom (Thad Luckinbill), until Nikki Newman (Melody Thomas Scott) took J. T. out with a fire poker — in a recent episode of The Young and the Restless.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"></figure><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>During the chit-chat, Ashland informed his ex that he now has "nothing to lose." At one point, Victoria told her visibly upset ex that no one will ever love him — which must have seemed like a feasible strategy in the heat of the moment.</p><p>During the scene, Ashland went ballistic, trying to inflict physical harm. Fortunately, Nick Newman (Joshua Morrow) pledged to come to the rescue — only to get stuck outside the house with no means of forcing his way in.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>With Nick hovering around in the outside area and an increasingly angry Ashland in front of her, Victoria had to fend for herself, or else. Cue: the fire poker.</p><p>But just as things were about to become too intense, Nick managed to gain entry and punch Ashland.
