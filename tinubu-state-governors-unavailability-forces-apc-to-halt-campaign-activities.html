At the end of the day, whether the harmonisation meeting eventually hold or not, they will still send the final list to the party’s leadership for ratification.”</p><p>The source revealed that the governors’ schedule also affected the zonal reconciliation tour billed to commence this week in Kano and Borno.</p><p>According to the source, the tour would have been unsuccessful without the involvement of the APC governors.</p><p>“As you know, the zonal reconciliation visits would have commenced in Kano and Borno this week Wednesday, Governor Umar Ganduje was ready, but his Borno State counterpart, Governor Zulum, was not disposed.</p><p>“The NWC would have kick-started the South West zonal visit from Lagos this weekend, but Governor Sanwo-Olu has serious engagements and indisposed for the visit. I think most of the governors have tight schedule, especially those in the entourage of President Muhammadu Buhari in the visits to some States,” he said.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpiZH16e5BwZq2hnqqvtnnSrZitnV2cvLex0aemq6tdqruiwsCio5qamaG2tcWMn6arm5WoeqK8wmarqGWYlrm1ecKapKmZmZy7bq3CraCvoaSesrR7</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./416421-newly-elected-tanzanian-mp-perturbed-learn-salaries-allowances-low-not-like-kenya-html.html><span>←</span><span>Newly Elected Tanzanian MP Perturbed to Learn Salaries, Allowances are Low, Not Like Kenya</span></a>
