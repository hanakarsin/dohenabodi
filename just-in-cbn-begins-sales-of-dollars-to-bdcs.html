The sum of $20,000 is to be sold to each BDC at the rate of ₦1,301/$- (representing the lower band rate of executed spot transactions at NAFEM for the previous trading day, as of today, 27th February 2024).</p><p>“All BDCs are allowed to sell to end-users at a margin NOT MORE THAN one per cent (1 per cent) above the purchase rate from CBN.</p><p>“All eligible BDCs are directed to make the Naira payment to the designated CBN Foreign Currency Deposit Naira Accounts and submit confirmation of payment, with other necessary documentation, for disbursement at the appropriate CBN Branches ABUJA, AWKA, LAGOS and KANO.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpkZH1ze5FwZqOto6l6qrqMnJmnZZKatKq60maqmqSVqHqwsoydpqWkkafAbsDOZpmdm6Nk</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./the-wiggles-relationships.html><span>←</span><span>The Wiggles' Relationships Prove That Intra-Band Love Can Work</span></a>
