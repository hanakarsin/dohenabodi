Her understanding of "zero dollars" however must've been different from the folks who awarded her the car. She tweeted at the company stating she was "PISSED" because it was apparently a used vehicle that needed its alternator fixed.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Twitter</span></figure><p>She conceded that yes, while they paid for the inspection she still had to front the cost for the license plates and repairs on the prize, which amounted to $405.15. She also mentioned that she had to front the tax costs of the vehicle.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Twitter</span></figure><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Twitter</span></figure><p>Some responded that "gifted" vehicles in certain states don't necessitate taxes, but others chimed in stating that the legalities attached to "gifted" cars as opposed to ones that were won in giveaways could be different.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Twitter</span></figure><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Twitter</span></figure><p>LexiRae stated that she wasn't "ungrateful" but that coming into ownership of the car had costs associated with them that she wasn't ready for.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Twitter</span></figure><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Twitter</span></figure><p>The story was posted to Reddit's <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Choosing Beggars sub</a>, which sparked ire from commenters, who remarked that she was in for a rude awakening when it came to monthly insurance costs on the car, along with paying for gas, registration and, depending on where she lived, parking costs.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Twitter</span></figure><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Reddit</span></figure><p>If anyone reading this lives in the New York or New Jersey area and travels quite frequently between the two states, then they'll know they can add a significant monthly amount of money for tolls as well. (I spend around $200 a month alone in tolls alone, not to mention some $155 in insurance charges as well. That doesn't include parking in NYC and the occasional contest of parking tickets that were incorrectly issued by meter officers.)</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Reddit</span></figure><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Reddit</span></figure><p>For the most part, people didn't seem to really sympathize with LexiRae's gifted car problems. Paying $405.15 for a running, working vehicle, as long as the repairs were performed correctly and the work is insured really isn't that much for a reliable mode of transportation. But what do you think? Does she have a right to complain? Or is this a case of somebody looking a gift horse in the mouth?</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Reddit</span></figure><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Reddit</span></figure><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfoq6vecWrnJ5lk5a%2Fbr7EmqOlsV2jvLV5xaucng%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./texts-from-ex-boss-twitter.html><span>←</span><span>The Internet Is Cry-Laughing at This Woman's Hilarious Conversation With Her Former Boss</span></a>
