My husband @bishopkiuna was diagnosed with cancer and was away seeking treatment. Chemotherapy had him losing hair, gaining weight, and unable to do much physically; he was unable to stand or walk for long and had to tiptoe around from the immense pain in his legs,” Kathy said, adding, “Chemotherapy had him at his lowest. What was most difficult for me was having to be home preaching most of the time and not by his side physically, and honestly speaking, it took all of me to even stand and preach.<a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/47266850d5a0854b.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=29><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Exciting entertainment news: Terence Creative drama, Akothee, Mbosso and more</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Kathy also revealed that she used to go before God shedding tears because of the situation her husband was going through.</p>Most of what I preached last year, was more for me than anyone else, it was God speaking to me at the same time using me to get to someone. Regardless of how I felt, I had to show my husband that we would get through this and show strength even when it was hard and would later go on my knees and remind God of His promises most times with tears rolling down my face. In that season, I learned to put the weight of my faith in God. It is easy to say ‘My faith is in God’ yet still want to do things on your own and find other ways, especially when you feel like God is ‘taking time, Kathy stated.<p class=align-left>The JCC reverend went a mile further and shared photos of her husband from being weak and without hair to when he regained his health.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/845448f4b52a4f6f.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=30><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Trending celebrity news: Diamond Platnumz, Willy Paul, Lupita Nyongo, Lilian Muli & More</span></p></a>The first and second pictures were my husband during chemotherapy, the third was on our way back home after treatment, the fourth was when he was now in church and preaching but had to wear a hat and still could not stand for long and the fifth is God's grace in action, taken last week during 40 Days Of Glory. His hair has grown back, he is physically fit, he can run, jump, stand for hours, and when I see this, it is a reminder that all glory is to God, she wrote.<p class=align-left>To motivate those going through similar situations, she reiterated that God is the key to successfully overcoming any challenges in life.</p>Whatever it is you're going through, put all your faith (stop considering options B, C, or trying to work it out yourself) in God and His promises. God's grace will cause you to stand where you fell. It does not matter how long you have been down the Grace of God is stepping in & you shall have strength, power, favour & anointing. I see my husband laying hands on the sick, and they're getting healed, and I realise he had to go through what he went through to access a new level, and so shall it be for you,” Kathy concluded.<a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/0fdb9b81f9408110.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=30><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Latest celebrity news: Willy Paul expose, Jalang'o, Rayvanny, Nicki Minaj & more</span></p></a><h3>3.

So we don’t really pay attention to pressures. However, I will say this, society does put a lot of pressure on people to bring forth children, and it's okay, but we all have to be sensitive to people's feelings because you never know what they have been through or are going through. We must, therefore, articulate our desires with a dose of sensitivity, he stated.<a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/51af7cb8473ea83b.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=30><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Latest celebrity news: Tanasha Donna, Huddah, Lilian Muli, Ringtone & more</span></p></a><p class=align-left>The Citizen TV 10 over 10 host admitted that he was ready to have a kid at any time.</p>I am looking forward to the day I will hear a little angel call me daddy.

It ended in him tying the knot with Mary at a private ceremony in 2017. Their beautiful wedding was unfortunately accompanied by a disaster honeymoon.</p><h3>4.

As recording artists, it is our sole duty to entertain our fans and NOT deploy our content to propagate hate against any person, most importantly, women. As artists, we are sons to our mothers, brothers to our sisters, uncles to our nieces and friends to our female friends and fans, and it is not in any way our intention to publicize violence or [sexual assault] against these highly revered individuals in our community, Ethic Crew tweeted.<a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/b717d58661a0c105.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=31><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Trending celebrity news: Lupita Nyong'o, Otile Brown, Diamond, Zari, Anerlisa Muigai</span></p></a><p class=align-left>The band issued a public apology to everyone who felt offended by their song.</p>As Ethic Entertainment, we are truly remorseful for any dolour caused by the lyrics to our single, and for every single person that was triggered to a displeasing memory or emotion by it, receive our sincere apologies. Rest assured that no disrespect was intended, they added.<p class=align-left>Hours after the release of the song, Kenya Films Classification Board (KFCB) boss, Ezekiel Mutua demanded the members of the group be arrested terming their new song as pure rubbish.</p>I have spoken to Google to take down the song called Tarimbo by Ethic Entertainment, which advocates for the [sexual assault] of women. Promoting violence against women is criminal, and the DCI should arrest the entire bunch of musicians called Ethic, under Article 33, for going beyond the prescribed delimitations on freedom of expression by advocating for violence against women. We banned Wamlambez. People said we were killing creativity. I asked these morons if they could shout Wamlambez before their parents, and they said they could. I was baffled, Mutua wrote on Facebook.<a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/0fgjhs7shm9q1r33d.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=31><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Trending celebrity news: Mr Seed, Diana Marua, Zari, Diamond Platnumz, Joyce Omondi and more</span></p></a><p class=align-left>KFCB boss reiterated that he would not allow musicians to mislead this generation in the name of ever-growing freedom.</p>These so-called musicians and performers have defied everything decent societies hold dear. They have thrown morality to the four winds in the name of money and popularity. Unless decent people rise against the wave of immorality in Kenya, we are going to lose a generation in the name of creative freedom. No freedom is absolute. This time round we must draw the line! he said.<p class=align-left>Currently, Tarimbo and Timmy Dat’s Vitamin U have been age-restricted on YouTube streaming platform.</p>Google has confirmed to us that the two videos Tarimbo by Ethic and Vitamin U by Timmy T Dat are not available on YouTube to users with restricted mode turned on. Google has facilitated restriction for kids as long as the restriction mechanism is activated. The Board shall be vigilant to ensure this kind of unpalatable content is not accessed by children, Mutua wrote.<a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=30><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Entertainment news: Willy Paul, Rayvanny, Vera Sidika, pastor Ng'ang'a and many more</span></p></a><p class=align-left><strong>READ ALSO: </strong>Trending celebrity news: Willy Paul, Erick Omondi, Nzula Makosi and more</p><h3>5.

Ever wondered why some of your favourite artists are not in some events that’s you’d expect them to be in? It’s because in Kenya if don’t dance to a cartel’s tune then you are an enemy.
