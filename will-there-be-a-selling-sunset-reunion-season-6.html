Now that drama has started back up, will there be a reunion?</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Netflix</span></figure><p>Just over a year after the Season 5 premiere of <a href=#>Selling Sunset</a>, Season 6 became available to stream on <a href=#>Netflix</a> on May 19, 2023, and it is just as drama filled as ever. The series has already been <a href=#>renewed for a seventh season</a>.</p><p>So much has changed for everyone between Season 5 and Season 6, including <a href=#>Chrishell Stause</a> marrying <a href=#>G Flip</a> after her relationship with <a href=#>Jason Oppenheim</a> having been one of the main plot lines of the fifth season. Now that drama has started back up within the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Oppenheim Group</a>, it leaves a big question – will there be a Season 6 reunion?</p><p>With that in mind, here’s everything we know so far about this season’s possible reunion.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">The ‘Selling Sunset’ reunion for Season 6 is still up in the air.</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Netflix</a><p>The cast of 'Selling Sunset' Season 6 in their office.</p></figure><p>Although Season 5’s <a href=#>reunion episode</a> included drama-filled, must-see moments, it’s important to remember that it was the first reunion since Selling Sunset premiered in 2019. A cast reunion seems likely at the moment, but as of this publication, Netflix nor show producers or cast members have confirmed a reunion.</p><p>If a reunion episode were to take place, it could premiere two weeks after the Season 6 premiere on May 19, matching the same timeframe between episodes and reunion from the previous season. So, a reunion will hopefully premiere during the first or second week of June — if the reunion will be happening.</p><p>Since not much is known at this time, it’s also unclear if Netflix will try for a live reunion after the <a href=#>Love Is Blind</a> Season 4 <a href=#>live reunion</a> didn’t impress viewers with time delays.</p><p>That said, whether it's live or taped, a reunion is likely to include the entire Season 6 cast of Selling Sunset — including cast newcomers <a href=#>Bre Tiesi</a> and <a href=#>Nicole Young</a>.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">What could be discussed during a 'Selling Sunset' reunion for Season 6?</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Netflix</a></figure><p>Many <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">bombshells</a> occur throughout Season 6 involving the high-end realtors, including Jason himself. Chrishell even calls out a cast member on her <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Instagram Story</a>, saying they are “transparent.” She also stated, “The thirst for camera time on season 6 is REAL.”</p><p>The veteran realtor did not confirm the name of the cast member she was dissing on her Instagram Story, but she does <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">accuse</a> Nicole of being a “crackhead” and doing drugs in front of agents during a Season 6 episode. Nicole denies this, and even takes a drug test to prove otherwise.</p><p>Season 6 of Selling Sunset is now streaming on Netflix. Other than the possible reunion, there have been no announcements as of yet as to when Season 7 will premiere, and how many main cast members will be returning.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfrLatuIytn56qlWKvpnnAZqqepJyeu6h50q6lrJ2kYr%2Bmwc2ipqdlo5qutLvNZm0%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./samantha-lorraine-html.html><span>←</span><span>Samantha Lorraine - Age, Family, Bio</span></a>
