Anonymous sources within the Buhari administration told reporters&nbsp;that Buhari prefers to have 'a fellow Northerner' as his right-hand man.</p><p>The sources allege that Buhari did the same as the military head of state, adding that the president is uneasy with Prof&nbsp;Osinbajo who has been tagged "<i>Tinubu’s boy</i>".</p><p>They claim that if it were in the powers of the president to appoint a vice, then certainly he would not have picked the professor as his running mate.</p><p>One source said:<i> “The President, clearly, prefers and places more trust on El-Rufai as far as matters of governance are concerned. El-Rufai has played a key role in some of the president’s appointments. He nominated Amina Bala Zakari for appointment as the acting INEC&nbsp;chairman, forcing Buhari to go against Jega’s earlier decision and planted his chief of staff, who is also the founder of the Bring Back Our Girls campaign, Hadiza Bala Usman inside President Buhari’s recently constituted anti-corruption advisory committee.”</i></p><p>There are various online reports and speculations that Osinbajo is not regarded by El-Rufai and many other northerners within Buhari’s adhoc cabinet. They believe that the vice president is 'just a puppet in Tinubu's hands'.</p><p>According to a source that spoke to The Trent, an incident which took place few weeks ago buttress the fact that Nigeria's vice president is looked down upon within the administration.</p><p>The source revealed that at a meeting in Aso Rock, Governor El-Rufai, in disagreeing with Osinbajo’s notion, raised his voice and insulted the VP. Osinbajo reportedly got upset, told El-Rufai off and told the president:</p><p><i>"I am an elected Vice President of this country, I will not sit here while an ordinary governor insults me in your presence. I deserve some respect."&nbsp;</i>Having said that, Osinbajo, allegedly stormed out of the meeting in rage, leaving Buhari&nbsp;and others present shocked.</p><p>The Kaduna governor reportedly condemned the behaviour of the vice president, demanded that Buhari&nbsp;did something about the disrespectful act.</p><p><strong>READ ALSO:</strong> Spiritual Attack?

He tweeted a photo with Osinbajo showing clearly there’s no rivalry between him and Osinbajo.</p><p>He also reposted a long article by Yomi Ewetade&nbsp;on his Facebook account, blasting the report about alleged rivalry as false.</p><p>"<i>TheTrentOnline completely fabricates scenarios that is not known to truth,</i>" claims&nbsp;Ewetade in his article, adding "<i>not only that, the website makes references to previously baseless claims that have been conclusively rebutted and dismissed, ignoring the very basic ethical commitment to truth of a journalist and a media outlet.</i>"</p><p>Meanwhile, Governor El-Rufai on Wednesday, September 16, did something that some deemed highly controversial. He ordered the shutting down of four Christian institutions, all located in Saminaka, Lere local government area of the state.</p><p>The governor, however, defended the action, stating that he shut the churches down in order to guide against violence among factions of the congregations whose leaderships’ positions sees as</p><p>Source: Legit.ng</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rbHGoqtnppdkgnZ%2FkWppZpufo8Gzu9WeqayxXau2pLGMqameq5mZsq%2FAjKiqoqaSlreweceupKKkmZbBpr%2BMnqNmqqWbrqp51pqjpKtdl8KprdGiZaGsnaE%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./january23-html.html><span>←</span><span>January 23 Birthdays | Famous Birthdays</span></a>
